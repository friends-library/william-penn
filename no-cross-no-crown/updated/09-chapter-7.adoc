== Chapter VII. The Sin of Pride

Having thus discharged my conscience against that sort
of unlawful self which seeks to be a Christian,
a believer, and a saint,
while remaining a stranger to the cross of Christ and the holy exercises of it;
and having briefly described the nature of true worship,
and the use and role of the holy cross in order to
render its performance pleasing to Almighty God;
I shall now (if the Lord assists me) more largely
prosecute that other part of unlawful self,
which fills up the study, care, and conversation of the world,
presented in these three capital lusts: Pride, greed, and luxury.
From these three all other mischief does daily flow,
as streams from their proper fountains.
The mortifying of these evils makes up a great part of the work of the true cross,
making way for man`'s much-needed reformation in humility, temperance, love, patience,
heavenly-mindedness, and all other graces of the Spirit.

The care and love of all mankind are directed either to God or to themselves.
Those that truly love God above all are ever humbling themselves before His commands,
and loving self only in subservience to Him who is Lord of all.
But those who have rejected this love to God are lovers of themselves;
for all love must center in one of these two.
To this inordinate self-love,
the apostle rightly joins the vices of pride and high-mindedness;
for no sooner had the angels declined their love, duty, and reverence to God,
than they inordinately loved and valued themselves.
This quickly led them to overstep their proper habitation,
and aspire above the order of their creation.
Yes, it was pride that brought about the sad defection and dismal fall of those
who are kept in chains of darkness unto the judgment of the great day of God.

Pride, that pernicious evil,
commonly known by its motions and sad effects in every unmortified soul,
began the misery of mankind.
Pride is an excess of self-love, joined with an undervaluing of others,
and a desire for dominion over them; it is the most troublesome thing in the world.
There are four things by which pride has made itself best known to mankind,
the consequences of which have brought about a degree of misery equal to its evil.
The first is an inordinate pursuit of knowledge.
The second, an ambitious seeking and craving after power.
The third, an extreme desire after personal respect and esteem.
The last excess is that of worldly possessions and adornments.
To the just and true witness of the eternal God, placed in the souls of all people,
I appeal as to the truth of these things.

To the first,
it is plain that an inordinate desire for knowledge introduced man`'s misery,
and brought a universal fall from the glory of his primitive state.
Adam desired to be wiser than God had made him.
It was not enough to know his Creator,
and to give Him that holy homage to which his being and
his innocency naturally engaged and excited him;
nor to have an understanding above all the beasts of the field, the fowls of the air,
and the fishes of the sea;
joined with a power to rule over all the visible creation of God.
No, he must be as wise as God too.
This unwarrantable pursuit, this foolish and unjust ambition,
made him unworthy of the blessings he received from God.
It drove him out of paradise; and instead of being lord of the whole world,
Adam became the earth`'s most wretched vagabond.

What a sad change!
Instead of being as gods, they fell below the very beasts.
The lamentable consequence of this great defection has
been an exchange of innocency for guilt,
and of paradise for wilderness.
But what is even worse, in this state Adam and Eve acquired another god,
besides the only true and living God.
He that enticed them to all this mischief,
furnished them with a vain knowledge and a
dangerous wisdom--the skill of lies and evasions,
shifts, accusations and excuses.
They lost their plainness and sincerity;
and from an upright heart
(the image in which God had made him),
man became a crooked, twisting serpent;
the image of that unrighteous spirit to whose temptations he
yielded up his obedience and his paradisical happiness.

This is not limited to Adam;
for all who have fallen short of the glory of God are true-born sons of his disobedience.
They, like him, have eaten of what has been forbidden.
They have committed the things they ought not to have done,
and left undone the things they ought to have done.
They have sinned against that divine light and knowledge which God has given them.
They have grieved His Spirit,
and the dismal sentence has indeed been executed--
"`In the day that you eat thereof you shall surely die.`"^
footnote:[Genesis 2:17]
That is to say, '`When you do the thing which you ought not to do,
you shall no more live in My favor, nor enjoy the comfort and presence of My Spirit.`'
This is a dying to all those innocent and holy desires
and affections with which God created man;
and so he becomes cold and numb, insensible of the love of God, of His Holy Spirit,
power and wisdom, of the light and joy of His countenance,
of the evidence of a good conscience, and of the approbation of God`'s Holy Spirit.

Having fallen,
Adam`'s knowledge of God stood no more in a daily
experience of the love and work of God in his soul,
but in a notion of what he once knew and experienced.
This being not the true and living wisdom that is from above, but a mere picture,
it cannot preserve man in purity; but rather puffs up and makes people proud,
high-minded, and impatient of contradiction.
This was the state of the apostate Jews before Christ came,
and it has been the condition of apostate Christians ever since He came.
Besides a variety of bodily performances,
their religion stands either in what they once knew of the work of
God in themselves (a work from which they have revolted);
or in a historical belief and an imaginary conception of the
experiences and prophecies of such holy men and women of God as,
in all ages, have deserved the name and character of His true children.

Such a knowledge of God cannot be true,
and by experience we find that it ever brings forth quite contrary fruits to true wisdom.
For as "`the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, then gentle,
and easy to be entreated,`"^
footnote:[James 3:17]
so the knowledge of degenerate and unmortified men is first impure.
Indeed, it came by the commission of evil,
and is held in an impure conscience and heart which disobey God`'s law,
and daily do those things they ought not to do.
For this they stand condemned before God`'s judgment seat in the souls of men,
where the light of His presence searches the most hidden things of darkness,
the most secret thoughts and concealed inclinations of ungodly men.
Yes, this is false wisdom; and as it is impure, so it also is unpeaceable, cross,
and hard to be entreated.
It is forward, perverse, persecuting, and jealous that anyone should be better,
and then hating and abusing those that are.

It was this pride that made Cain a murderer; it is a spiteful quality,
full of envy and revenge.
What? Was his religion and worship not as good as his brother`'s?
He had all the exterior parts of worship.
He offered just as Abel did, and the offering in itself might have been as good;
but it seems the heart that offered it was not.
So long ago did God regard the interior worship of the soul.
What was the consequence of this difference?
Cain`'s pride could not bear to be outdone by his brother.
He grew wrathful,
and resolved to vindicate his offering by
revenging its rejection upon his brother`'s life.
And without any regard to natural affection, or the low and early condition of mankind,
he barbarously stained his hands in his brother`'s blood.

The religion of the apostatized Jews did no better;
for having lost the inward life, power, and Spirit of the law,
they were puffed up with the knowledge they had.
Their claims to Abraham, Moses, and the promises of God, in that condition,
served only to raise them up to a horrible pride, arrogance and cruelty.
They could not bear true vision when it came to visit them,
and entertained the messengers of their peace as if they had been wolves and tigers.

It is remarkable how the false prophets,
the great schemers against the true ones, were ever sure to persecute them as false;
and by their influence with earthly princes, or with the poor seduced multitude,
made other men the instruments of their malice.
So it was that one holy prophet was sawn asunder, and another stoned to death, etc.
Oh how proud and obstinate are false knowledge and all who aspire after it!
Indeed, this made holy Stephen cry out,
"`You stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ear, you resist the Holy Spirit;
as your fathers did, so do you.`"^
footnote:[Acts 7:51]

True knowledge came down with the joy of angels, singing
"`peace on earth, and goodwill towards men;`"^
footnote:[Luke 2:14]
and false knowledge entertained it with slander and violence.
Yes, they stoned Him, and frequently sought to kill Him;
and at last they wickedly accomplished it.
But what was their motive?
Because He cried out against their hypocrisy, their lifeless ceremonies,
and the honor they sought from men.
Indeed, they give the reason themselves in these words:
"`If we let Him thus alone, all men will believe in Him;`"^
footnote:[John 11:48]
'`He will take away our credit with the people; they will adhere to Him, and desert us,
and so we shall lose our power and reputation with the multitude.`'

The truth is,
He came to level their honor and overthrow their proud religious system,
and by His grace to bring a people to that inward knowledge of God which they,
by transgression, had long departed from.
Then they would see the deceitfulness of their blind guides who,
by their vain traditions, had made void the righteousness of God,
and who were so far from being the true teachers and living expounders of it,
that in reality they were the children of the devil--who was a
proud liar and cruel murderer from the beginning.

Seeing how their pride in false knowledge had made them
incapable of receiving the simplicity of the Gospel,
Christ thanks His Father that He had hidden its mysteries from the wise and prudent,
and revealed them unto babes.
This same false wisdom swelled the minds of the Athenians to such a degree that
they despised the preaching of the apostle Paul as a vain and foolish thing.
But this apostle
(who, more than all the rest was educated in the learning of those times),
bitterly reflects upon the wisdom so much valued by Jews and Greeks, saying:
"`Where is the wise?
Where is the scribe?
Where is the disputer of this world?
Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?`"^
footnote:[1 Corinthians 1:20]
And then gives a good reason for it, "`That no flesh should glory in His presence.`"^
footnote:[1 Corinthians 1:29]
Which is to say, God will stain the pride of men in their false knowledge,
that they should have nothing to be proud of;
for all will depend upon the revelation of the Spirit of God.

Indeed, the apostle goes even farther and affirms,
"`That the world through wisdom did not know God;`"^
footnote:[1 Corinthians 1:21]
that is to say, man`'s wisdom was so far from being a help, that, as men use it,
it was a hindrance to the true knowledge of God.
And in his first epistle to his beloved Timothy, he concludes thus:
"`O Timothy! Guard what was committed to your trust;
avoiding profane and vain babblings and contradictions
of what is falsely called knowledge.`"^
footnote:[1 Timothy 6:20]
This was the way of apostolic times,
when divine grace gave the true knowledge of God,
and was the guide of Christians.

But what has been the success of those ages that followed the apostles?
Is it any better than that of the Jewish times?
Alas, not one bit!
Indeed, they have exceeded the Jews in their pretenses to greater knowledge,
and also in their degeneracy from the true Christian life.
For though they have had a more excellent Pattern than the Jews,
to whom God spoke by Moses His servant--namely Christ, the beloved Son,
the express image of the Father`'s substance,
the perfection of all meekness and humility--and though
they seemed addicted to the adoration of His name,
and the veneration of His blessed disciples and apostles;
yet so great was their defection from the inward
power and life of Christianity in the soul,
that their reverence proved little more than formal and ceremonious.
Notwithstanding they, like the Jews, were zealous in decorating their sepulchers,
and busy in carving their images; yet,
with respect to the great and weighty things of the Christian law of life--namely, love,
humility, and self-denial--they were degenerate.
They grew to be high-minded, proud, boasters, without natural affection,
curious and controversial, ever perplexing the church with doubtful questions,
filling people with disputations, strife and wrangling,
drawing them into sects and divisions till they at last fell into bloodshed.

O the miserable state of these pretended Christians who,
instead of Christ`'s and His apostles`' doctrine of
loving enemies and blessing those that curse them,
teach the people (under a notion of Christian
zeal) to most inhumanly butcher one another.
And instead of suffering their own blood to be shed for the testimony of Jesus,
they shed the blood of the witnesses of Jesus, calling them heretics.
Thus that subtle serpent, or crafty evil-spirit, who tempted Adam out of innocency,
and coaxed the Jews from the law of God,
has beguiled the Christians by lying vanities to
depart from the Christian law of holiness.
Accordingly, they have become his slaves;
for he rules in the hearts of the children of disobedience.

It was pride (which is always followed by superstition and obstinacy),
that set Adam upon seeking a higher station than God placed him in.
The Jews, out of the same pride,
seeking to outdo the holy pattern given by God to Moses upon the mount,
taught for doctrines their own traditions,
insomuch that those who refused conformity to them ran the hazard of death.
So too nominal Christians, from the same sin of pride,
with great superstition and arrogance, have introduced,
instead of a spiritual worship and discipline,
that which is evidently ceremonious and worldly,
with their great innovations and traditions of men
which are the fruit of the wisdom that is from below.

And as this unwarrantable pride set them at first to
pervert the spirituality of Christian worship,
making it rather to resemble the shadowy religion of the Jews,
and the gaudy worship of the Egyptians,
than the plainness and simplicity of the Christian institution;
so has the same pride and arrogance spurred them on, by all imaginable cruelties,
to maintain their great image.
The meek supplications and humble protests of those that kept close to
primitive purity in worship and doctrine could not prevail with these
nominal Christians to dispense with the imposition of their traditions.
But as the ministers and bishops of these degenerate Christians grew ambitious, covetous,
and luxurious (more resembling worldly potentates than the
humble-spirited and mortified followers of the blessed Jesus),
so almost every history tells us with what pride and cruelty, blood and butchery,
and unusual and exquisite tortures, they have persecuted the holy members of Christ.
These, true Christians call martyrs;
but the clergy (like the persecuting Jews),
have called them blasphemers and heretics--so fulfilling the prophecy of our Lord.
No doubt such persecutors are the wolves that
the apostle foretold would arise among them,
not sparing the flock of Christ, after the great falling-away should commence;
which apostasy was foretold by him as being necessary, for the proving of the faithful,
and the revelation of the great mystery of iniquity.

I shall conclude this subject with the following assertion,
which is an undeniable truth: wherever the clergy has been most in power and authority,
and has had the greatest influence upon leaders and states, there,
there has been the most confusion, contention, bloodshed, imprisonments and exiles.
To prove this, I call upon the testimony of the records of all times.
How it is in our age, I leave to the experience of the living;
yet here is a charge that can hardly be disputed: the people are not converted,
but rather debauched to a lamentable degree.
The worship of Christendom is visible, ceremonious, and gaudy.
The clergy are ambitious of worldly preferments under a pretense of spiritual promotions,
making earthly revenue much the reason of their function.
Thus, with their pride and avarice
(which the apostle Peter foresaw would be their snares),
these have drawn after them great ignorance,
misery and godlessness upon the Christianity of our time.

The way of recovery from this miserable defection is
to come to a saving knowledge of true religion,
which is an experience of the divine work of God in the soul,
obtained by diligent obedience to the grace of God that appears in your own soul.
This grace brings salvation, turning you out of the broad way into the narrow way,
from your lusts to your duty, from sin to holiness, from Satan to God.
You must see and abhor self.
You must watch, and pray, and fast.
You must not look at your tempter, but at your Preserver.
Avoid evil company, retire to solitude, and be a chaste pilgrim in this evil world.
Thus you will arrive at the knowledge of God and
Christ which brings eternal life to the soul.

It was Christ`'s complaint of old,
"`That light had come into the world,
but men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.`"^
footnote:[John 3:19]
If you desire to be a child of God, and a believer in Christ,
you must be a child of light.
You must bring your deeds to it, and examine them by that holy lamp in your soul,
which is the candle of the Lord that shows you your pride and arrogance,
and reproves your delight in the vain fashions of this world.

True religion is a denial of self; yes and of self-religion too.
It is a firm tie or bond upon the soul to holiness, the end of which is happiness,
for by it men come to see the Lord.
"`The pure in heart,`" says Jesus, "`see God.`"^
footnote:[Matthew 5:8]
He that comes to bear Christ`'s yoke is not carried away by the devil`'s allurements;
indeed he finds far greater joys in his watchfulness and obedience.
Had Adam minded that holy light in paradise more than the serpent`'s bait,
and stayed his mind upon his Creator, the rewarder of fidelity,
he would have seen the snare of the enemy and resisted him.
O then, do not delight in that which is forbidden!
Look not upon it, if you desire not to be captivated by it.
Did Christ submit His will to His Father`'s, and, for the joy that was set before Him,
endure the cross and deny the shame of a new and untrodden way to glory?
You also must submit your will to Christ`'s holy law and light in your heart,
and for the reward He sets before you, endure His cross and despise the shame of it.
Many desire to rejoice with Him, but few will suffer with Him, or for Him.
They will follow Him for the loaves of bread, but the bitter cup of His agony they leave.
Yes, many will magnify His miracles, who are yet offended at the humiliation of His cross.
But O man! as He has done for your salvation,
so you must do for the love of Him--you must humble yourself,
and be content to be of no reputation, that you may follow Him; not in the carnal,
formal way, of vain man`'s tradition and prescription, but in "`the new and living way,`"^
footnote:[Hebrews 10:20]
which Jesus has consecrated.
All who walk in this way do travel to the eternal rest of God,
into which He Himself has entered, who is the holy and only blessed Redeemer.
