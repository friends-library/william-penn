Some Objections Considered and Answered

[.discourse-part]
Objection:
But some may object that the attributes and effects which we ascribe
to the light within belong rather to the Spirit and grace of God,
which are the peculiar blessings of the new and second covenant,
and the fruit of the coming of Christ.

[.discourse-part]
Answer:
If it appears that the properties ascribed to the light within are the same
with those that are given to the Holy Spirit and grace of God;
then surely these are but various terms or epithets,
used to express the diverse manifestations or operations of one and the same Spirit.

Now, to try the case,
and to see whether the light within is of the
same nature with the Spirit and grace of God,
and tends to the same end (which is to bring people to God),
let the properties of the light be compared with those of the Spirit and grace of God.
First, the light proceeds from the one Word, and the one life of that one Word,
which was with God and was God, John 1:4, and 1:9.
Secondly, it is universal, that is, it is said to enlighten every man.
Thirdly, it gives the knowledge of God, and fellowship with Him, Rom. 1:19.
John 3:21. 1 John 1:5-6.
Fourthly, it manifests and reproves evil, John 3:20. Ephesians 5:13.
Fifthly, it is made the rule and guide of Christian living, Ps. 43:3.
John 8:12. Ephesians 5:13,15.
Sixthly, it is the path for God`'s people to walk in,
Ps. 119:105. Proverbs 4:18. Isaiah 2:5. 1 John 1:7. Rev. 21:24,
"`And the nations of those who are saved, shall walk in the light of the Lamb.`"
Lastly, it is the armor of the children of God against Satan, Ps. 27:1,
"`The Lord is my light, whom shall I fear?`"
And Romans 13:12, "`Let us put on the armor of light.`"

Now let all this be compared with the properties of the Holy Spirit,
and their agreement will be very manifest.
First, the Spirit proceeded from God, because it is the Spirit of God, Rom. 8:11.
Secondly, it is universal; it strove with the old world (Gen. 6:3),
and no doubt does so with the new one as well.
Everyone has a measure of it given to profit withal, 1 Cor. 12:7.
Thirdly, it reveals God, Job 32:8, 1 Cor. 2:10-11.
Fourthly, it reproves for sin, John 16:8.
Fifthly, it is a rule and guide for the children of God to walk by, Rom. 8:14.
Sixthly, it is also the path they are to walk in, Rom. 8:1. Gal. 5:16,
"`Walk in the Spirit.`"
Lastly, it is likewise the spiritual weapon of every true Christian, Ephesians 6:17,
"`Take up the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.`"
So then,
I hope none will deny that this light and this Spirit must be of one and the same nature,
work one and the same effect, and tend evidently to one and the same holy end.

And what is said of the light and Spirit,
may also very well be said of the light and grace of God.
For first, the grace flows from Christ--the Word that took flesh--as well as the light;
for even as "`in Him was life, and the life was the light of men,`"^
footnote:[John 1:4]
so He was also "`full of grace and truth,`" John 1:14,
and "`of His fullness have all we received, and grace for grace,`" John 1:16. Secondly,
it is universal, which can be seen both in the foregoing text,
and from the apostle`'s words to Titus; "`For the grace of God that brings salvation,
has appeared to all men,`" Titus 2:11. Thirdly, it manifests evil,
for "`it teaches to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts,`" vs. 12.
Fourthly, it reveals godliness, and so consequently must manifest God.
Fifthly, it is an instructor and guide; for the apostle says,
"`It teaches to live soberly, righteously,
and godly in this present world;`" and herein is the rule or guide of the Christian life.
Sixthly, it is to those who receive it all that they can need or desire, 2 Cor. 12:9,
"`My grace is sufficient for you;`"--a strong testimony from
heaven to the power of this teaching and saving grace,
under even the strongest temptations.

[.discourse-part]
Objection: But there is little mention made of the Spirit, and none of the grace,
before Christ`'s coming, and therefore the Spirit,
as spoken of in the writings of the New Testament, and more especially the grace,
must be another, and a nobler thing than the light within.

[.discourse-part]
Answer: By no means another thing,
but another name for another manifestation or operation of the same Spirit.
It is called light from the perception and discerning it gives.
"`Let there be light, and there was light,`" said God in the beginning of the old world.
So too there is first light in the beginning of the new creation of God in man.
It is called Spirit, because it gives life, sense, motion, and vitality,
and thus it is often mentioned in the writings of both Old and New Testaments.
By this Spirit, God strove with the world before the flood (Gen. 6:3),
and with Israel in the wilderness (Neh. 9:30).
And David asked in the agony of his soul,
"`Where shall I go from Your Spirit?`" (Ps. 139:7);
and the prophets often felt it.
And it is called grace, not from its being another Spirit,
but because it was a fuller dispensation of the
virtue and power of the same divine Spirit;
which, being purely God`'s favor and mercy, and not man`'s merit,
is rightly called the grace of God to undeserving man.

The wind does not always blow strongly,
nor does heaven always send down rain freely,
nor does the sun always shine forth clearly.
Shall we therefore say it is not of the same _kind_ of wind, rain, or light,
when it blows, rains, or shines but a little,
as when it blows, rains, or shines much?
It is certainly the same in nature and kind;
and so it is with this blessed Spirit under all its various dispensations,
manifestations, and operations, which are all for the benefit of man`'s soul,
ever since the world began.

And we most freely,
humbly and thankfully acknowledge that the dispensation of the Gospel is the clearest,
fullest, and noblest of all others,
both with regard to the coming of Christ in the flesh to be
our one holy offering for sin through the eternal Spirit;
and in the breaking forth of His light, the effusion of His Spirit,
and the appearance of His grace in and unto man,
in a more excellent manner after His ascension.
For though it was not another light or Spirit than that
which He had given to man in former ages,
yet it was another and greater measure;
and this is the great privilege of the Gospel above all former dispensations.

What before shined but dimly, shines since with greater glory.
What then appeared but darkly, now appears with open face.
Types, figures, and shadows veiled His appearances and made His glory look low and faint;
but in the Gospel time the veil is rent and the hidden glory is now made manifest.
Under the law it was but as dew or a small rain, but under the Gospel,
it may be said to be poured out upon all men,
according to that gracious and notable promise of God by the prophet Joel:
"`In the latter days I will pour out My Spirit upon all flesh.`"^
footnote:[Joel 2:28; Acts 2:17]

When it rains plentifully, we say,
'`Look how it pours!`' So too God has augmented His light,
grace and Spirit to all in these latter days.
They shall not have it sparingly and by small drops,
but fully and freely and overflowingly too.
Thus Peter, that deep and excellent apostle,
applied the promise in Joel to the day of Pentecost as
the beginning of the accomplishment of it.
This is grace and favor and goodness indeed!
And therefore rightly may this brighter illumination,
this greater effusion of the Spirit, be called grace;
for as the coming of the Son excelled the time of the servant,
so did the manifestation of the light and Spirit of God since the coming of Christ,
excel that of all foregoing dispensations;
yet it was ever sufficient to salvation for all who walked in it.

This is our sense of the light, Spirit, and grace of God.
And by what is said, it is evident they are one and the same, and that he who has light,
need not lack the Spirit or grace of God,
if he will but "`receive it in the love of it.`"^
footnote:[2 Thessalonians 2:10]
For the very light that appears to him, is also Spirit to quicken him,
and grace to teach, help, and comfort him.
It is sufficient in all circumstances of life to those who diligently mind and obey it.

[.discourse-part]
Objection: But some may yet say, "`If it is as you declare,
why is it then that all who are enlightened, are not so good as they ought to be,
or as good as this light would make them?`"

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Because people do not receive and obey it.
All men have reason, but all men are not reasonable.
Is it the fault of the grain which lies in the storehouse that it yields no increase,
or of the talent hidden in the handkerchief that it accrues no interest?

[.small-break]
'''

It is plain in the parable that a talent was given;
and it is equally plain that it was capable of increase--both
because identical talents had gained in the hands of others,
and that the just Judge expected His talent with interest.
Now, whose fault was it that the talent did not increase?
Was it not the unprofitable servant who was unfaithful with little?
The blind must not blame the sun,
nor sinners charge the grace of God with insufficiency.
It is sin that darkens the eye, hardens the heart,
and hinders good things from the sons of men.
Christ tells us, "`If anyone wills to do His will,
he shall know concerning the doctrine.`"^
footnote:[John 17:17]
Men not living up to what they know cannot blame God that they know no more.
The unfruitfulness is in us, not in the talent,
and it would be well indeed if this were laid to heart.

[.discourse-part]
Objection: But some yet object, "`If mankind has always had the Holy Spirit,
why is it that Gospel truths were not so fully known before
the coming of Christ to those that were obedient to it?`"

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Because a child is not a grown man, nor is the beginning the end;
and yet He that is the beginning is also the end.
The Spirit is the same, though not the manifestation,
and they that are faithful to what they know of the
dispensation of their own day shall hear the happy welcome of,
"`Well done, good and faithful servant.`"^
footnote:[Matthew 25:21]

And yet many of God`'s people in those days did
have a view of the glory of latter times,
the improvement of the covenant, and the happiness of the church of God.
This we see plainly in the prophecy of Jacob and Moses
concerning the restoration of Israel by the Messiah.
And David, in many of his excellent psalms,
expresses a most sensible and extraordinary enjoyment of the Spirit,
and prophesies things to come.^
footnote:[Particularly his 2nd, 15th, 18th, 22nd, 23rd, 25th, 27th, 32nd, 36th, 37th,
42nd, 43rd, 45th, 51st, 84th, etc.]
The prophets are full of such expressions, and for that reason have their name.^
footnote:[Particularly Isaiah, chapters 2nd, 9th, 11th, 25th, 28th, 32nd, 35th, 42nd,
49th, 50th, 51st, 52nd, 53rd, 54th, 59th, 60th, 61st, 63rd, 65th, 66th. Jeremiah also,
chapters 23rd, 30th, 31st, 33rd. Ezekiel, chapters 20th, 34th, 36th, 37th. Daniel,
chapters 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th. Hosea, chapters 1st, 3rd. Joel, chapters 2nd,
3rd. Amos, chapter 9th. Micah, chapters 4th, 5th. Zachariah, chapters 6th, 8th, 9th,
11th, 13th, 14th. Malachi, chapters 3rd, 4th.]
All of this was not another Spirit, but another manifestation of the same.
The Spirit that came upon Moses was the same that came upon John the Baptist;
and the Spirit that came upon Gideon and Sampson, also fell upon Peter and Paul;
but it was not the same dispensation of that Spirit.

It has been the way of God to visit and appear
to men according to their states and conditions,
and according as they have been prepared to receive Him,
be it more outwardly or inwardly, sensibly or spiritually.
There is no human capacity too low or too high for the reach of this Divine Spirit;
for as He made and knows all, so He reaches unto all people.
He extends to the lowest, and yet the highest cannot subsist without Him.
This made David break forth in his distress, saying,
"`Where shall I go from Your Spirit, or where shall I flee from Your presence?`"^
footnote:[Ps. 139:7]
Here he implies that the Spirit is everywhere,
though not everywhere or at every time alike.
"`If I ascend into heaven, You are there;
If I make my bed in hell, behold, You are there.
If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,
even there Your hand shall lead me, and Your right hand shall hold me.`"^
footnote:[Ps. 139:8-10]
Yes, even there this Divine Word, this light of men, this Spirit of God, will find me,
lead me, help me, and comfort me.
For it is with me wherever I am and wherever I go, in one respect or other.
"`When you go, it shall lead you; when you sleep, it shall keep you;
and when you awake, it shall talk with you;`"^
footnote:[Proverbs 6:22]
and I could no more get rid of it, if I so desired,
than of myself--so present is it with me, and so close does it stick to me.

[.discourse-part]
Objection: But if the Jews had this light,
it does not follow that the Gentiles had it also; but by your doctrine all have it.

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, and it is the glory of this doctrine which we profess
that God`'s love is thereby held forth to all.
And besides the texts already cited
(which are as full and positive as can be expressed),
the apostle is very particular in the second chapter of his Epistle to the Romans,
"`That the Gentiles, not having the law, did by nature the things contained in the law,
and were a law unto themselves.`"
That is, they did not have an outward law as the Jews had,
but they had "`the work of the law written in their hearts,`"^
footnote:[Romans 2:15]
and so, having the law in themselves, they might well be a law unto themselves.

So the Jews had it too,
but they also had greater outward helps to quicken their obedience to it,
such as God did not afford to any other nation.
It is for this reason that the obedience of the
Gentiles (or uncircumcision) is said to be by nature,
or naturally, because it was without those additional, external,
and extraordinary laws and signs which the Jews were given to provoke them to duty.
But this is so far from discounting the obedient Gentiles,
that it rather exalts them in the apostle`'s judgment;
because though they had less advantages than the Jews,
yet the work of the law written in their hearts was made so
much the more evident by the good life they lived in the world.

Paul then adds, "`their consciences bearing witness,`" or as it may be rendered,
witnessing with them, "`and their thoughts, meanwhile, accusing,
or else excusing one another,
in the day when God shall judge the secrets of all hearts by Jesus Christ,
according to my Gospel.`"^
footnote:[Romans 2:15-16]
This presents us with four things to our point, and worth our serious reflection: First,
that the Gentiles had the law written in their hearts.
Secondly, that their conscience was an allowed witness or evidence regarding their duty.
Thirdly, that the judgment made thereby shall be confirmed by
the apostle`'s Gospel at the great Day,
and therefore be valid and irreversible.
Fourthly, that this could in no way be the case,
unless the light that shined in the conscience were a divine and sufficient light.

[.discourse-part]
Objection: But it may be said, "`If it is all the work of one Holy Spirit,
then why so many modes and forms of religion since the world began?
For the Patriarchal, Mosaic, and Christian, all have their great differences;
not to mention what has befallen the Christian religion
since the beginning of its publication to the world?`"

[.discourse-part]
Answer: I do not know how these may properly be called diverse religions,
since they all assert the true God for the object of worship,
the Lord Jesus Christ for the only Savior,
and the light or Spirit of Christ for the great agent
and means of man`'s conversion and eternal happiness,
any more than infancy, youth, and manhood make up three men,
instead of three growths or periods of time in one and the same man.
But passing that by, the many modes or ways of God appearing to men,
arise (as has been said) from the diverse states of men,
in all of which it seems to have been God`'s main design to prevent idolatry
and vice by directing their minds to the true object of worship,
and pressing virtue and holiness.
To the patriarchs, He seems to have spoken mostly by angels in the fashion of men,
over and above the inward illumination of the Spirit.
To the prophets, for the most part,
He communicated by the revelation of the Holy Spirit in them,
and accordingly through them to the Jews.
And since the Gospel dispensation, He has spoken by His Son,
both externally by His coming in the flesh,
and internally by His spiritual appearance in the soul as the great light of the world.
Yet in all of these dispensations,
the use of outward instruments or agents should be understood as a "`sowing of light`"^
footnote:[Ps. 97:11]
into the earth from the same Spirit,
which co-operates with the manifestation of light
immediately experienced in man`'s own breast.

This is of great weight, both for our information and encouragement,
that God`'s work, in reference to man, is one and the same,
and that His eye has ever been upon the same thing in all His dispensations, namely,
to make men truly good, by planting His holy awe and fear in their hearts.
However, He has condescended, because of the hardness and darkness of men`'s hearts,
to approach and spell out His holy mind to them by low and outward ways,
allowing Truth to put on various sorts of garments,
in order to better reach to the low state of men,
and turn them from false gods and wicked lives.

And if we do but consider the reason of the prevalence of idolatry upon the
earlier and darker times of the world (of which Scripture is very particular),
we shall find that it arises from this: that their worship was more sensual,
and therefore calculated to please the senses of men, being more outward and visible,
and more in their own power to perform than a worship more spiritual in nature.
They desired to see the object of their devotion,
and have it in their power to address it how and whenever they would.
For this reason, God, by many judgments and great deliverances,
brought forth a people to Himself,
that they might remember and worship the Hand that saved them, and in so doing,
root up idolatry,
and plant the knowledge and fear of Him in their minds as an example to other nations.
Whoever reads Deuteronomy, which is a summary of the other four books of Moses,
will find the frequent and earnest care and
concern of that good man about this very point,
and will see how often Israel slipped and lapsed
(notwithstanding God`'s love, care, and patience over them)
into the idolatrous customs of the nations about them.^
footnote:[Several other Scriptures inform us of the same,
especially those of the prophets, Isaiah 54 and 4, Psalms 37, 115, and Jeremiah 10,
where the Holy Spirit confutes and rebukes the people,
and mocks their idols with a sort of holy disdain.--W. P.]

Now that which is furthest from idolatry, and the best antidote against it,
is the very Spirit of God of which we have spoken.
And the more people`'s minds are turned and brought to it, and the more their faith,
worship, and obedience are bound to the holy illumination and power of it,
the nearer they come to the purpose of their creation, and consequently to their Creator.
These are more spiritually qualified, and become better fitted to worship God as He is;
for (as we are told by our Lord Jesus Christ) He is a Spirit,
and will be worshiped in Spirit and in Truth.
These are such worshipers as God seeks to worship Him in this Gospel day.

"`The hour is coming,`" says He, "`and now is;`"^
footnote:[John 4:23]
that is to say, '`some now do, but more shall`'--
which was a plain assertion for the present time,
and a promise and prophecy of the increase of such worshipers in the future.
This shows a change intended from a ceremonial worship and state of the church of God,
to a spiritual one.
Thus the text, "`But the hour is coming, and now is,
when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in Spirit and in Truth;`"^
footnote:[John 4:23]
which is to say, when the worship of God shall be more inward than outward,
and thus more suitable to the nature of God and to the
nobler part of man--the inward and better man.
This worship is in Spirit, that is, through the power of the Spirit; and in Truth,
that is, in substance, not in shadows, ceremonies, or formalities.
Behold, a worship in sincerity, with and in the life of God,
being divinely prepared and animated,
which both brings man to offer up what is pleasing to Him,
and lifts his soul into intimate communion and fellowship with God, who is a Spirit.

And if it be duly weighed, it will appear that God,
in all the various manifestations of Himself,
has come nearer and nearer to the insides of men,
that He might reach to their understandings, open their hearts,
and give them a plainer and nearer acquaintance with Himself in Spirit.
It is there, in the heart,
that man must seek and find the knowledge of God for his eternal happiness.

All things that are made,
show forth the power and wisdom of God and His goodness to mankind.
Indeed,
many appeal to the majesty of creation to silence the atheistical objections of men.
But though all created things show forth a God, yet man does so above all the rest.
He is the precious stone on the ring, and the most glorious jewel on the globe.
Man is a composition of both worlds; his body is of this, his soul of the other world.
The body is as the temple of the soul, the soul the temple of the living Word,
and the Word the great temple and manifestation of God.
By the body, the soul looks into and beholds the creation,
and by the Word it beholds its God and the world that is without end.
Much might be said of this order of things, but I desire to be brief.
