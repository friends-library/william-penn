== Chapter XXVI.

1694.--As William Penn had been honourably acquitted of
those charges which prevented his return to America,
it might naturally be supposed that he would immediately prepare for a voyage thither.
But there were several reasons for delay.
The decease of his wife had left a charge upon him
which he could not conscientiously neglect.
His wife`' left two sons and one daughter, all minors;
whose education of course demanded a father`'s care.
This of itself would probably have been enough to detain him for a time in England.
His heavy expenditures in Pennsylvania, the very small returns from that quarter,
and the losses sustained in Ireland, in consequence of the commotions there,
had subjected him to considerable pecuniary difficulty.
The events which had occurred in relation to the government of Pennsylvania,
as will be related in a subsequent chapter, left a task to be accomplished at home,
previous to his return thither.

In the year 1694, he wrote a preface to the Journal of George Fox,
who died as already mentioned, in 1690.
This journal was transcribed and prepared for the press by Thomas Ellwood.
The preface, by William Penn, is a treatise of itself,
and has been frequently published separately from
the work to which it was originally prefixed,
under the title of A brief account of the rise and progress of the people called Quakers.

_First,_ As a standing testimony to that ever blessed Truth, in the inward parts,
with which God in my youthful time, visited my soul,
and for the sense and love of which I was made willing, in no ordinary way,
to relinquish the honours and interests of the world.

_Secondly,_ As a testimony for that despised people, whom God in his great mercy,
has gathered and united by his own blessed spirit in the holy profession of it;
whose fellowship I value above all worldly greatness.

_Thirdly,_ In love and honour to the memory of that worthy servant of God, George Fox,
the first instrument thereof,
and therefore styled by me the great and blessed apostle of our day.
As this gave birth to what is here presented to thy view, in the first edition of it,
by way of preface to George Fox`'s excellent journal;
so the consideration of the present usefulness of
the following account of the people called Quakers,
by reason of the unjust reflections of some adversaries
who once walked under the profession of Friends,
and the exhortations that conclude it,
prevailed with me to consent that it should be republished in a smaller volume;
knowing also full well, that great books, especially in these days, grow burdensome,
both to the pockets and minds of many; and that there are not a few that desire,
so it be at an easy rate, to be informed about this people,
who have been so much everywhere spoken against.
But, blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
it is upon no worse grounds than it was said of old time of the primitive Christians;
as I hope will appear to every sober and considerate reader.
Our business, after all the ill usage we have met with, being the realities of religion;
an effectual change before our last and great change; that all may come to an inward,
sensible and experimental knowledge of God,
through the convictions and operations of the light and spirit of Christ in themselves,
the sufficient and blessed means given to all,
that thereby all may come savingly to know the only true God and Jesus Christ,
whom he hath sent to enlighten and redeem the world: which knowledge is, indeed,
eternal life.
And that thou, reader, mayest obtain it, is the earnest desire of him that is ever

=== Section I. / Containing a brief account of divers dispensations of God in the world, to the time he was pleased to raise this despised people called Quakers.

Divers have been the dispensations of God,
since the creation of the world to the sons of men;
but the great end of all of them has been the renown of his own
excellent name in the creation and restoration of man--man,
the emblem of himself, as a god on earth, and the glory of all his works.
The world began with innocency: all was then good that the good God had made:
and as he blessed the works of his hands,
so their natures and harmony magnified him their Creator.
Then the morning stars sang together for joy,
and all parts of his works said Amen to his law.
There was not a jar in the whole frame; but man in paradise, the beasts in the field,
the fowl in the air, the fish in the sea, the lights in the heavens,
the fruits of the earth; yea, the air, the earth, the water and fire, worshipped,
praised and exalted his power, wisdom and goodness.
O holy sabbath, O holy day to the Lord!

But this happy state lasted not long: for man, the crown and glory of the whole,
being tempted to aspire above his place, unhappily yielded, against command and duty,
as well as interest and felicity, and so fell below it, lost the Divine image,
the wisdom, power and purity in which he was made.
Thus being no longer fit for paradise, he was expelled that garden of God,
his proper dwelling and residence, and was driven out, as a poor vagabond,
from the presence of the Lord, to wander in the earth, the habitation of beasts.

Yet God who made him had pity on him; for he, seeing man was deceived,
and that it was not of malice, or an original presumption in him,
but through the subtlety of the serpent, who had first fallen from his own state,
and by the mediation of the woman, man`'s own nature and companion,
whom the serpent had first deluded,
in his infinite goodness and wisdom provided a way to repair the breach,
recover the loss, and restore fallen man again, by a nobler and more excellent Adam,
promised to be born of a woman; that as,
by means of a woman the evil one had prevailed upon man,
by a woman also He should come into the world,
who would prevail against him and bruise his head, and deliver man from his power:
and which, in a signal manner, by the dispensation of the Son of God in the flesh,
in the fulness of time, was personally and fully accomplished by him, and in him,
as man`'s Saviour and Redeemer.

But his power was not limited, in the manifestation of it, to that time;
for both before and since his blessed manifestation in the flesh,
he has been the light and life, the rock and strength of all that ever feared God.
He was present with them in their temptations,
followed them in their travels and afflictions,
and supported and carried them through and over the difficulties
that attended them in their earthly pilgrimage.
By Him Abel`'s heart excelled Cain`'s; Seth obtained the preeminence,
and Enoch walked with God.
It was he that strove with the old world, and whom they rebelled against,
and who sanctified and instructed Noah to salvation.

But the outward dispensation that followed the benighted state of man after his fall,
especially among the patriarchs, was generally that of angels,
as the Scriptures of the Old Testament in many places express, as to Abraham, Jacob, etc.
The next was that of the law by Moses, which was also delivered by angels,
as the apostle tells us.
This dispensation was much outward, and suited to a low and servile state;
called therefore by the apostle Paul, that of a schoolmaster,
which was to point out and prepare that people to look and long for the Messiah,
who would deliver them from the servitude of a ceremonious and imperfect dispensation,
by knowing in themselves the realities of those mysterious representations.
In this time the law was written on stone, and the temple was built with hands,
attended with an outward priesthood and external rights and ceremonies,
that were shadows of the good things which were to come,
and were only to serve till the Seed came,
or the more excellent and general manifestation of Jesus Christ, to whom was the promise,
and to all men only in him, in whom it was yea and amen, even life from death,
immortality and eternal life.

The prophets foresaw the coming of Christ,
and comforted the believing Jews in the certainty of it.
That was the top of the Mosaical dispensation, which ended in John`'s ministry,
who was the forerunner of the Messiah, and John`'s was finished in Jesus Christ,
who is the fulness of all.
Then God, who at sundry times, and in divers manners,
had spoken to the fathers by his servants the prophets,
spoke to men by his Son Christ Jesus, who is heir of all things.
This is the Gospel-day, the dispensation of Sonship;
bringing in thereby a nearer testament and a better hope;
even the beginning of the glory of the latter days, and of the restitution of all things;
yea, the restoration of the kingdom unto Israel.

Now the spirit, that was more sparingly communicated in former dispensations,
began to be poured forth upon all flesh, according to the prophet Joel;
and the light that shined in darkness, or but dimly before,
the most gracious God caused to shine out of darkness,
and the day-star began to arise in the hearts of believers,
giving them the knowledge of God in the face, or appearance, of his Son Christ Jesus.

The poor in spirit, the meek, the true mourners,
the hungry and thirsty after righteousness, the peace-makers, the pure in heart,
the merciful and persecuted, came more especially into remembrance before the Lord,
and were sought out and blessed by Israel`'s true Shepherd.
Old Jerusalem with her children grew out of date, and the New Jerusalem into request,
the mother of the sons of the Gospel day.
Wherefore no more at old Jerusalem, nor at the mountain of Samaria,
will God be worshipped above other places; for behold, he is, by his own Son,
declared and preached to be a Spirit, and that he will be known as such,
and worshipped in the spirit and in the truth!
He will now come nearer than of old time, "`and he will write his law in the heart,
and put his fear and Spirit in the inward parts,`" according to his promise.
Then signs, types and shadows flew away,
the day having discovered their insufficiency in not reaching to the "`inside of the cup,
to the cleansing of the conscience;`" and all elementary services
were ended in and by Him who is the substance of all.

To this great and blessed end of the dispensation of the Son of God,
did the apostles testify, whom he had chosen and anointed by his Spirit,
to turn the Jews from their prejudice and superstition,
and the Gentiles from their vanity and idolatry,
to Christ`'s light and Spirit that shined in them;
that they might be quickened from the sins and trespasses in which they were dead,
to serve the living God, in the newness of the Spirit of life,
and walk as children of the light, and of the day, even the day of holiness.
For such put on Christ, the light of the world, and make no more provision for the flesh,
to fulfill the lusts thereof.

So that the light, spirit and grace, that comes by Christ, and appears in man,
is that Spirit of Truth from which the apostles ministered
and turned peoples`' minds unto,
and in which they gathered and built up the churches of Christ in their day.
For this cause they advise the believers not to quench the Spirit,
but to wait for the Spirit, and speak by the Spirit, and pray by the Spirit,
and walk in the Spirit too,
as that which approved them the truly begotten children of God,
born not of flesh and blood, nor of the will of man, but of the will of God,
by doing his will and denying their own; by drinking of Christ`'s cup,
and being baptized with his baptism of self-denial,
the way and path which all the heirs of life have ever trodden to blessedness.
But alas! even in the apostles`' days (those bright stars
of the first magnitude of the Gospel light) some clouds,
foretelling an eclipse of this primitive glory, began to appear,
and several of them gave early caution of it to the Christians of their time,
that even then there was, and yet would be more and more,
a falling away from the power of godliness,
and the purity of that spiritual dispensation,
by such as sought to make a fair show in the flesh,
but with whom the offence of the cross ceased; yet with this comfortable conclusion,
that they saw, beyond it, a more glorious time than ever to the true church.
Their sight was true, and what they foretold to the churches,
gathered by them in the name and power of Jesus, came to pass.
For Christians degenerated apace into outsides, as days and meats,
and divers other ceremonies.
And, which was worse, they fell into strife and contention about them;
separating one from another, then envying, and, as they had power,
persecuting one another to the shame and scandal of their common Christianity,
and to the grievous stumbling and offence of the heathen,
among whom the Lord had so long and so marvellously preserved them.
And having got at last the worldly power into their hands,
by kings and emperors embracing the Christian profession,
they changed as far as they could, the kingdom of Christ, which is not of this world,
into a worldly kingdom; or at least styled the worldly kingdom, that was in their hands,
the kingdom of Christ, and so they became worldly, and not true Christians.
Then human inventions and novelties, both in doctrine and worship,
crowded fast into the church; a door being opened thereunto,
by the grossness and carnality which appeared among the generality of Christians,
who had left the guidance of God`'s meek and heavenly Spirit,
and given themselves up to superstition, will-worship, and voluntary humility.
And as superstition is blind, so it is heady and furious;
for all must stoop to its blind and boundless zeal, or perish by it:
in the name of the Spirit,
persecuting the very appearance of the Spirit of God in others,
and opposing that in others which they resisted in themselves, viz: the light,
grace and Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ; but always under the notion of innovation,
heresy, schism, or some such plausible name.
But Christianity allows of no name or pretence whatever
for persecuting any man for matters of mere religion,
being in its very nature, meek, gentle and forbearing; and consists of faith,
hope and charity, which no persecutor can have, whilst he remains a persecutor.
A man cannot believe well or hope well,
nor have a charitable or tender regard to another, whilst he would violate his mind,
or persecute his body, for matters of faith or worship towards his God.

Thus the false church sprang up, and mounted the chair: but though she lost her nature,
she would needs keep her good name of the Lamb`'s bride,
the true church and mother of the faithful: constraining all to receive her mark,
either in their forehead or right hand; that is, publicly or privately.
But in deed and in truth she was mystery Babylon, the mother of harlots, mother of those,
who with all their show and outside of religion, were gone from the Spirit,
nature and life of Christ, and grown vain, worldly, ambitious, covetous, cruel, etc,
which are the fruits of the flesh, and not of the Spirit.

Now it was, that the true church fled into the wilderness, that is,
from superstition and violence, to a retired, solitary, and lonely state; hidden,
and as it were, out of sight of men, though not out of the world.
Which shows that her wonted visibility was not essential to the
being of a true church in the judgment of the Holy Ghost;
she being as true a church in the wilderness, though not as visible and lustrous,
as when she was in her former splendour of profession.
In this state she made many attempts to return, but the waters were yet too high,
and her way blocked up, and many of her excellent children,
in several nations and centuries, fell by the cruelty of superstition,
because they would not fall from their faithfulness to the Truth.

The last age took some steps towards it, both as to doctrine, worship, and practice.
But practice quickly failed: for wickedness flowed in a little time,
as well among the professors of the reformation, as those they reformed from;
so that by the fruits of conversation they were not to be distinguished.
And the children of the reformers, if not the reformers themselves,
betook themselves very early, to earthly policy and power,
to uphold and carry on their reformation that had been begun with spiritual weapons;
which, I have often thought,
has been one of the greatest reasons why the reformation made no better progress,
as to the life and soul of religion.

For whilst the reformers were lowly and spiritually minded, and trusted in God,
and looked to him, and lived in his fear, and consulted not with flesh and blood,
nor sought deliverance in their own way, there were daily added to the church such,
as one might reasonably say, should be saved:
for they were not so careful to be safe from persecution,
as to be faithful and inoffensive under it;
being more concerned to spread the truth by their faith and patience in tribulation,
than to get the worldly power out of their hands
who inflicted those sufferings upon them.
It will be well if the Lord suffer them not to fall,
by the very same way which they took to stand.

In doctrine they were in some things short; in other things, to avoid one extreme,
they ran into another; and for worship, there was, for the generality,
more of man in it than of God.
They owned the Spirit, inspiration and revelation, indeed,
and grounded their separation and reformation upon
the sense and understanding they received from it,
in the reading of the Scriptures of Truth.
And this was their plea, the Scripture is the text, the Spirit the interpreter,
and that to everyone for himself.
But yet there was too much of human invention, tradition and art,
remained both in praying and preaching;
and of worldly authority and worldly greatness in their ministers;
especially in this kingdom, Sweden, Denmark, and some parts of Germany.
God was therefore pleased in England to shift us from vessel to vessel:
and the next remove humbled the ministry, so that they were more strict in preaching,
devout in praying, and zealous for keeping the first-day of the week,
and catechising of children and servants, and repeating at home in their families,
what they had heard in public.
But even as these grew into power, they were not only for whipping some out,
but others into the temple: and they appeared rigid in their spirits,
rather than severe in their lives, and more for a party than for piety,
which brought forth another people, that were yet more retired and select.

They would not communicate at large, or in common with others;
but formed churches among themselves of such as could give some account of their conversion,
at least of very promising experiences of the work of God`'s grace upon their hearts;
and under mutual agreements and covenants of fellowship, they kept together.
These people were somewhat of a softer temper,
and seemed to recommend religion by the charms of its love, mercy and goodness,
rather than by the terrors of its judgments and punishments;
by which the former party would have awed people into religion.

They also allowed greater liberty to prophecy than those before them;
for they admitted any member to speak or pray, as well as their pastor,
whom they always chose, and not the civil magistrate.
If such found any thing pressing upon them to either duty,
even without the distinction of clergy or laity, persons of any trade,
be it ever so low and mechanical, had the liberty.
But alas! even these people suffered great loss: for tasting of worldly empire,
and the favour of princes, and the gain that ensued, they degenerated.
Though they had cried down national churches and ministry, and maintenance too,
some of them, when it was their own`' turn to be tried,
fell under the weight of worldly honour and advantage, got into profitable parsonages,
and outlived and contradicted their own principles: and, which was yet worse,
some of them turned absolute persecutors of other men for God`'s sake,
who but so lately came themselves out of the furnace.
This drove many a step farther, and that was into the water; into another baptism,
believing they were not Scripturally baptized;
and hoping to find that presence and power of God,
in submitting to this watery ordinance, which they desired and wanted.

These people also made profession of neglecting, if not renouncing and censuring,
not only the necessity, but use of all human learning, as to the ministry,
and all other qualifications to it, besides the helps and gifts of the Spirit of God,
and those natural and common to men.
And for a time they seemed, like John of old,
a burning and a shining light to other societies.

They were very diligent, plain and serious; strong in Scripture and bold in profession;
bearing much reproach and contradiction.
But that which others fell by, proved their snare.
Worldly power spoiled them too,
who had enough of it to try what they would do if they had more:
and they rested also too much upon their watery dispensation,
instead of passing on more fully to that of the fire and Holy Ghost,
which was His baptism, who came with a fan in his hand,
that he might thoroughly (and not in part only) purge his floor,
and take away the dross and the tin of his people, and make a man finer than gold.

Withal they grew high, rough and self-righteous, opposing farther attainment:
too much forgetting the day of their infancy and littleness,
which gave them something of a real beauty; insomuch that many left them,
and all other visible churches and societies, and wandered up and down,
as sheep without a shepherd, and as doves without their mates; seeking their beloved,
but could not find him, as their souls desired to know him,
whom they loved above their chiefest joy.

These people were called Seekers by some, and the Family of love by others; because,
as they came to the knowledge of one another, they sometimes met together,
not formally to pray or preach at appointed times or places, in their own wills,
as in times past they were accustomed to do, but waited together in silence;
and as any thing rose in any one of their minds that
they thought savoured of a Divine spring,
they sometimes spoke.
But so it was, that some of them not keeping in humility, and in the fear of God,
after the abundance of revelation, were exalted above measure;
and for want of staying their minds in an humble
dependence upon Him who opened their understandings,
to see great things in his law, they ran out in their own imaginations,
and mixing them with those Divine openings, brought forth a monstrous birth,
to the scandal of those who feared God and waited
daily in the temple not made with hands,
for the consolation of Israel; the Jews inward, and circumcision in spirit.

This people obtained the name of Ranters, from their extravagant discourses and practices.
They interpreted Christ`'s fulfilling the law for us,
to be a discharging of us from any obligation and duty the law required,
instead of the condemnation of the law for sins past, upon faith and repentance:
and that now it was no sin to do that which before it was a sin to commit:
the slavish fear of the law being taken off by Christ, and all things good that man did,
if he did but do them with the mind and persuasion that it was so.
Hence many of them fell into gross and enormous practices; pretending, in excuse thereof,
that they could, without evil, commit the same act which was sin in another to do;
thereby distinguishing between the action and the evil of it,
by the direction of the mind and intention in the doing of it.
This was to make sin superabound by the aboundings of grace,
and to turn from the grace of God into wantonness, a securer way of sinning than before;
as if Christ came not to save us from our sins, but in our sins; not to take away sin,
but that we might sin more freely at his cost, and with less danger to ourselves.
I say, this ensnared many,
and brought them to an utter and lamentable loss as to their eternal state;
and they grew very troublesome to the better sort of people,
and furnished the looser with an occasion to profane.

=== Section II. / Of the rise of the people called Quakers, their fundamental principle, doctrine and practice, in twelve points resulting from it; their progress and sufferings: an expostulation with England thereupon.

It was about that very time, as you may see in George Fox`'s Annals, that the eternal,
wise and good God, was pleased, in his infinite love,
to honour and visit this benighted and bewildered
nation with his glorious dayspring from on high;
yea, with a most sure and certain sound of the word of light and life,
through the testimony of a chosen vessel, to an effectual and blessed purpose,
can many thousands say; glory be to the name of the Lord forever.

For as it reached the conscience and broke the heart,
and brought many to a sense and search,
so that which people had been vainly seeking without, with much pains and cost,
they by this ministry found within, where it was they wanted what they sought for, viz:
The right way to peace with God.
They were directed to the light of Jesus Christ within them,
as the seed and leaven of the kingdom of God; near all, because in all,
and God`'s talent to all: a faithful and true witness, and just monitor in every bosom;
the gift and grace of God, to life and salvation, which appears to all,
though few regard it.
This the traditional Christian, conceited of himself,
and strong in his own will and righteousness, overcome with blind zeal and passion,
either despised as a low and common thing or opposed as
a novelty under many hard names and opprobrious terms,
denying, in his ignorant and angry mind,
any fresh manifestations of God`'s power and Spirit in man in these days,
though never more needed to make true Christians.
Not unlike those Jews of old who rejected the Son of God,
at the very same time that they blindly professed to wait for the Messiah to come;
because, alas! he appeared not among them according to their carnal mind and expectation.

This brought forth many abusive books, which filled the greater sort with envy,
and the lesser with rage;
and made the way and progress of this blessed testimony
straight and narrow indeed to those who received it.
However, God owned his own work, and this testimony did effectually reach, gather,
comfort and establish the weary and heavy laden, the hungry and thirsty,
the poor and needy, the mournful and sick of many maladies,
who had spent all upon physicians of no value, and waited for relief from heaven,
help only from above.
Upon a serious trial of all things they saw that nothing else would do but Christ himself;
the light of his countenance, a touch of his garment, and help from his hand,
who cured the poor woman`'s issue, raised the centurion`'s servant, the widow`'s son,
the ruler`'s daughter, and Peter`'s mother; and like her,
they no sooner felt his power and efficacy upon their souls,
but they gave up to obey him in a testimony to his power;
and that with resigned wills and faithful hearts, through all mockings, contradictions,
confiscations, beatings, prisons,
and many other jeopardies that attended them for his blessed name`'s sake.

And truly these were very many, and very great;
so that in all human probability they must have been swallowed up quickly
of the proud and boisterous waves that swelled and beat against them,
but that the God of all their tender mercies was with them in his glorious authority;
so that the hills often fled, and the mountains melted before the power that filled them;
working mightily for them, as well as in them, one ever following the other.
By which they saw plainly, to their exceeding great confirmation and comfort,
that all things were possible with Him with whom they had to do;
and that the more that which God required seemed to cross man`'s wisdom,
and expose them to man`'s wrath,
the more God appeared to help and carry them through all to his glory.

If ever any people could say in truth, thou art our sun and our shield,
our rock and sanctuary, and by thee we have leaped over a wall,
and by thee we have run through a troop,
and by thee we have put the armies of the aliens to flight,
these people had a right to say it.
And as God had delivered their souls from the wearisome burdens of sin and vanity,
and enriched their poverty of spirit,
and satisfied their great hunger and thirst after everlasting righteousness,
and filled them with the good things of his own house,
and made them stewards of his manifold gifts;
so they went forth to all quarters of these nations,
to declare to the inhabitants thereof what God had done for them; what they had found,
and where and how they had found it, viz: The way to peace with God;
inviting all to come, and see, and taste for themselves,
the truth of what they declared unto them.

And as their testimony was to the Spirit of God in man,
the precious pearl and leaven of the kingdom,
as the only blessed means appointed of God to quicken, convince and sanctify man,
so they opened to them what it was in itself, and what it was given to them for:
how they might know it from their own spirit,
and that of the subtle appearance of the evil one:
and what it would do for all those whose minds should
be turned from the vanity of the world,
and its lifeless ways and teachers, and adhere to this blessed light in themselves,
which discovers and condemns sin in all its appearances, and shows how to overcome it,
if minded and obeyed in its holy manifestations and convictions.
It gives power to such to avoid and resist those things that do not please God,
and to grow strong in love, faith and good works; that so man,
whom sin hath made as a wilderness over-run with briars and thorns,
might become as the garden of God, cultivated by his divine power,
and replenished with the most virtuous and beautiful plants of God`'s own planting,
to his eternal praise.

But these experimental preachers of the glad tidings of God`'s truth and kingdom,
could not run when they listed, nor pray or preach when they pleased,
but as Christ their Redeemer prepared and moved them by his own blessed spirit,
for which they waited in their services and meetings,
and spoke as that gave them utterance; which was as those having authority,
and not like the dreaming, dry and formal pharisees.
And so it plainly appeared to the serious minded,
whose spiritual eye the Lord Jesus had in any measure opened;
so that to one was given the word of exhortation, to another the word of reproof,
to another the word of consolation,
and all by the same Spirit and in the good order thereof,
to the convincing and edifying of many.

And truly they waxed strong and bold through faithfulness,
and by the power and spirit of the Lord Jesus became very fruitful,
thousands in a short time being turned to the truth
in the inward parts through their testimony,
in ministry and sufferings;
insomuch that in most counties and many of the considerable towns of England,
meetings were settled, and daily there were added such as should be saved.
They were diligent to plant and to water,
and the Lord blessed their labours with an exceeding great increase,
notwithstanding all the opposition made to their progress by false rumours,
calumnies and bitter persecutions; not only from the powers of the earth,
but from every one that listed to injure and abuse them.
They seemed indeed to be as poor sheep appointed to the slaughter,
and as a people killed all the day long.

It were fitter for a volume than a preface,
to set forth the extent of their cruel sufferings from professors as well as from profane,
and from magistrates as well as the rabble.
It may be said of this abused and despised people,
they went forth weeping and sowed in tears, bearing testimony to the precious Seed,
even the Seed of the kingdom, which stands not in words, (the finest,
the highest that man`'s wit can use) but in the power of Christ Jesus,
to whom God the Father hath given all power in heaven and in earth,
that he might rule angels above, and men below.
Who empowered them, as their work witnesseth, by the many that were turned,
through their ministry, from darkness to the light,
and out of the broad into the narrow way of life and peace; bringing people to a weighty,
serious, and Godlike conversation; the practice of that doctrine which they taught.

And, as without this secret Divine power there is no quickening
and regenerating of dead souls,
so the want of this regenerating and begetting power and life,
is the cause of the little fruit that the many ministries,
that have been and are in the world, bring forth.
O that both ministers and people were sensible of
this! my soul is often troubled for them,
and sorrow and mourning compass me about for their sakes.
O that they were wise!
O that they would consider,
and lay to heart the things that truly and substantially make for their lasting peace!

Two things are to be considered, the doctrine they taught,
and the example they led among all people.
I have already touched upon their fundamental principle,
which is as the corner-stone of their fabric; and indeed,
to speak eminently and properly, their characteristic,
or main distinguishing point or principle, viz: The light of Christ within,
as God`'s gift for man`'s salvation.
This, I say,
is as the root of the goodly tree of doctrines that grew and branched out from it,
which I shall now mention in their natural and experimental order.

First, repentance from dead works to serve the living God.
Which comprehends three operations.
First, a sight of sin.
Secondly, a sense and godly sorrow for sin.
Thirdly, an amendment for the time to come.
This was the repentance they preached and pressed,
and a natural result from the Spirit of Truth, they turned all people unto.
For of light came sight; and of sight came sense and sorrow;
and of sense and sorrow came amendment of life;
which doctrine of repentance leads to justification; that is,
forgiveness of the sins that are past, through Christ the alone propitiation,
and the sanctification or purgation of the soul,
from the defiling nature and habits of sin present, by the Spirit of Christ in the soul;
which is justification in the complete sense of that word;
comprehending both justification from the guilt of the sins that are past,
as if they had never been committed, through the love and mercy of God in Christ Jesus;
and the creature`'s being made inwardly just through the cleansing
and sanctifying power and spirit of Christ revealed in the soul;
which is commonly called sanctification.
But that none can come to know Christ to be their
sacrifice that reject him as their sanctifier;
the end of his coming being to save his people from the nature and defilement,
as well as guilt of sin: and that therefore those who resist his light and spirit,
make his coming and offering of none effect to them.

From hence sprang a second doctrine they were led to declare,
as the mark of the prize of the high calling to all true Christians, viz.,
Perfection from sin, according to the Scriptures of truth;
which testify it to be the end of Christ`'s coming, and the nature of his kingdom,
and for which his Spirit was and is given,
viz. To be perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect, and holy, because God is holy.
And this the apostles laboured for,
that the Christians should be sanctified throughout in body, soul and spirit;
but they never held a perfection in wisdom and glory in this life,
or from natural infirmities or death, as some have, with a weak or ill mind,
imagined and insinuated against them.

This they called a redeemed state, regeneration, or the new birth:
teaching everywhere according to their foundation, that unless this work was known,
there was no inheriting the kingdom of God.

Thirdly, This leads to an acknowledgment of eternal rewards and punishments,
as they have good reason; for else, of all people,
certainly they must be the most miserable, who, for above forty years,
have been exceedingly great sufferers for their profession,
and in some cases treated worse than the worst of men; yea,
as the refuse and off-scouring of all things.

This was the purport of their doctrine and ministry; which, for the most part,
is what other professors of Christianity pretend to hold in words and forms,
but not in the power of godliness; which, generally speaking,
has been long lost by men`'s departing from that
holy Spirit and Seed of life that is in man,
and which man has not regarded, but lost the sense of:
and in and by which only he can be quickened in his
mind to serve the living God in newness of life.
For as the life of religion was lost,
and the generality lived and worshipped God after their own wills,
and not after the will of God, nor the mind of Christ,
which stood in the works and fruits of the holy Spirit;
so that which they pressed was not notion, but experience; not formality, but godliness;
as being sensible in themselves, through the work of God`'s righteous judgments,
that without holiness no man shall ever see the Lord with comfort.

Besides these general doctrines, as the larger branches,
there sprang forth several particular doctrines,
that did exemplify and further explain the truth
and efficacy of the general doctrine before observed,
in their lives and examples.
As,

[.numbered-group]
====

[.numbered]
I+++.+++ Communion and loving one another.
This is a noted mark in the mouth of all sorts of people concerning them, They will meet,
they will help and stick one to another.
Whence it is common to hear some say,
Look how the Quakers love and take care of one another.
Others, less moderate, will say, The Quakers love none but themselves:
and if loving one another, and having an intimate communion in religion,
and constant care to meet to worship God and help one another,
be any mark of primitive Christianity, they had it, blessed be the Lord,
in an ample manner.

[.numbered]
II. To love enemies.
This they both taught and practised.
For they did not-only refuse to be revenged for injuries done them,
and condemned it as of an unchristian spirit, but they did freely forgive, yea,
help and relieve those that had been cruel to them,
when it was in their power to have been even with them:
of which many and singular instances might be given; endeavouring,
through faith and patience, to overcome all injustice and oppression,
and preaching this doctrine as Christian, for others to follow.

[.numbered]
III.
Another was, The sufficiency of truth-speaking,
according to Christ`'s own form of sound words, of yea, yea, and nay, nay,
among Christians, without swearing;
both from Christ`'s express prohibition to swear at all, Matt, v.,
and for that they being under the tie and bond of truth in themselves,
there was no necessity for an oath;
and it would be a reproach to their Christian veracity to
assure their truth by such an extraordinary way of speaking;
simple and uncompounded answers, as yea and nay, without asseveration, attestation,
or supernatural vouchers, being most suitable to evangelical righteousness.

But offering at the same time to be punished to the full, for false speaking,
as others are for perjury, if ever guilty of it.
And hereby they exclude, with all true, all false and profane swearing;
for which the land did and doth mourn, and the great God was,
and is not a little offended with it.

[.numbered]
IV. Not fighting, but suffering, is another testimony peculiar to this people;
they affirm that Christianity teacheth people to beat their swords into plough-shares,
and their spears into pruning-hooks, and to learn war no more;
that so the wolf may lie down with the lamb, and the lion with the calf,
and nothing that destroys be entertained in the hearts of the people;
exhorting them to employ their zeal against sin, and turn their anger against Satan,
and no longer war one against another;
because all wars and fightings come of men`'s own hearts`' lusts,
according to the apostle James, and not of the meek spirit of Christ Jesus,
who is captain of another warfare, and which is carried on with other weapons.
Thus, as truth-speaking succeeded swearing, so faith and patience succeeded fighting,
in the doctrine and practice of this people.
Nor ought they for this to be obnoxious to civil government,
since if they cannot fight for it, neither can they fight against it;
which is no mean security to any state.
Nor is it reasonable that people should be blamed for not
doing more for others than they can do for themselves.
And Christianity set aside, if the costs and fruits of war were well considered, peace,
with all its inconveniences, is always preferable.
But though they were not for fighting, they were for submitting to government; and that,
not only for fear, but for conscience-sake,
where government doth not interfere with conscience;
believing it to be an ordinance of God, and where it is justly administered,
a great benefit to mankind.
Though it has been their lot, through blind zeal in some, and interest in others,
to have felt the strokes of it with greater weight
and rigour than any other persuasion in this age;
whilst they, of all others, religion set aside,
have given the civil magistrate the least occasion
of trouble in the discharge of his office.

[.numbered]
V+++.+++ Another part of the character of this people was and is,
they refuse to pay tithes or maintenance to a national ministry;
and that for two reasons: the one is, they believe all compelled maintenance,
even to Gospel ministers, to be unlawful,
because expressly contrary to Christ`'s command, who said, Freely you have received,
freely give.
At least, that the maintenance of Gospel-ministers should be free and not forced.
The other reason of their refusal is, because those ministers are not Gospel ones,
in that the holy Ghost is not their foundation, but human arts and parts.
So that it is not matter of humour nor sullenness, but pure conscience towards God,
that they cannot help to support national ministries where they dwell,
which have but too much and too visibly become ways of worldly advantage and preferment.

[.numbered]
VI. Not to respect persons, was and is another of their doctrines and practices,
for which they were often buffeted and abused.
They affirmed it to be sinful to give flattering titles,
or to use vain gestures and compliments of respect.
Though to virtue and authority they ever made a difference;
but after their plain and homely manner, yet sincere and substantial way;
well remembering the examples of Mordecai and Elihu,
but more especially the command of their Lord and Master, Jesus Christ,
who forbade his followers to call man Rabbi, which implies lord or master;
also the fashionable greetings and salutations of those times;
that so self-love and honour,
to which the proud mind of man is incident in his fallen estate,
might not be indulged but rebuked.
And though this rendered their conversation disagreeable,
yet they that will remember what Christ said to the Jews, "`How can ye believe,
which receive honour one of another,`" will abate of their resentment,
if his doctrine has any credit with them.

[.numbered]
VII.
They also used the plain language of thee and thou to a single person,
whatever was his degree among men: and indeed, the wisdom of God was much seen,
in bringing forth this people in so plain an appearance;
for it was a close and distinguishing test upon the spirits of those they came among;
showing their insides, and what predominated,
notwithstanding their high and great profession of religion.
This, among the rest, sounded so harsh to many of them, and they took it so ill,
that they would say, Thou me, thou my dog!
If thou thou`'st me, I`'ll thou thy teeth down thy throat;
forgetting the language they use to God in their own prayers,
and the common style of the Scriptures,
and that it is an absolute and essential propriety of speech.
And what good, alas! had their religion done them,
who were so sensibly touched with indignation for the use of this plain,
honest and true speech?

[.numbered]
VIII.
They recommend silence by their example, having very few words upon all occasions.
They were at a word in dealing: nor could their customers, with many words,
tempt them from it, having more regard to truth than custom, to example than gain.
They sought solitude; but when in company, they would neither use,
nor willingly hear unnecessary or unlawful discourses:
whereby they preserved their minds pure and undisturbed
from unprofitable thoughts and diversions.
Nor could they humour the custom of Good night, Good morrow, God speed;
for they knew the night was good, and the day was good, without the wishing of either;
and that in the other expression,
the holy name of God was too lightly and unthankfully used, and therefore taken in vain.
Besides, they were words and wishes of course, and are usually as little meant,
as are love and service in the custom of cap and knee; and superfluity in those,
as well as in other things, was burdensome to them;
and therefore they did not only decline to use them,
but found themselves often pressed to reprove the practice.

[.numbered]
IX. For the same reason they forbore drinking to people, or pledging of them,
as the manner of the world is: a practice that is not only unnecessary, but they thought,
evil in the tendencies of it, being a provocation to drink more than did people good,
as well as that it was in itself vain and heathenish.

[.numbered]
X+++.+++ Their way of marriage is peculiar to them,
and shows a distinguishing care above other societies professing Christianity.
They say that marriage is an ordinance of God,
and that God only can rightly join man and woman in marriage:
therefore they use neither priest nor magistrate; but the man and woman concerned,
take each other as husband and wife, in the presence of credible witnesses,
promising to each other, with God`'s assistance,
to be loving and faithful in that relation, till death shall separate them.
But antecedent to this,
they first present themselves to the Monthly Meeting for the affairs of the church,
where they reside;
there declaring their intentions to take one another as husband and wife,
if the said meeting have nothing material to object against it.
They are constantly asked the necessary questions, as in case of parents and guardians,
if they have acquainted them with their intention, and have their consent, etc.
The method of the meeting is, to take a minute thereof,
and to appoint proper persons to inquire of their
conversation and clearness from all others,
and whether they have discharged their duty to their parents or guardians;
and to make report thereof to the next Monthly Meeting,
where the same parties are desired to give their attendance.
In case it appears they have proceeded orderly, the meeting passes their proposal,
and so records it in the meeting-book.
And in case the woman be a widow, and hath children, due care is there taken,
that provision also be made by her for the orphans,
before the meeting passes the proposals of marriage: advising the parties concerned,
to appoint a convenient time and place, and to give fitting notice to their relations,
and such friends and neighbours,
as they desire should be the witnesses of their marriage:
where they take one another by the hand, and by name promise reciprocally,
love and fidelity, after the manner before expressed.
Of all which proceedings, a narrative, in way of certificate is made,
to which the said parties first set their hands,
thereby confirming it as their act and deed; and then relations, spectators and auditors,
set their names, as witnesses of what they said and signed.
And this certificate is afterwards registered in the record
belonging to the meeting where the marriage is solemnized.
Which regular method has been, as it deserves, adjudged in courts of law,
a good marriage, where it has been by cross and ill people disputed and contested,
for want of the accustomed formalities of priest and ring,
etc. ceremonies they have refused, not out of humour, but conscience reasonably grounded;
inasmuch as no Scripture example tells us, that the priest had any other part,
of old time, than that of a witness among the rest,
before whom the Jews used to take one another;
and therefore this people look upon it as an imposition
to advance the power and profits of the clergy:
and for the use of the ring, it is enough to say,
that it was an heathenish and vain custom, and never in practice among the people of God,
Jews or primitive Christians: the words of the usual form,
as with my body I thee worship, etc, are hardly defensible.
In short, they are more careful, exact and regular, than any other form now used;
and it is free from the inconveniences, with which other methods are attended:
their care and checks being so many, and such,
as that no clandestine marriages can be performed among them.

[.numbered]
XI. It may not be unfit to say something here of their births and burials,
which make up so much of the pomp of too many called Christians.
For births, the parents name their own children:
which is usually some days after they are born, in the presence of the midwife,
if she can be there, and those that were at the birth;
who afterwards sign a certificate for that purpose prepared,
of the birth and name of the child or children: which is recorded in a proper book,
in the Monthly Meeting to which the parents belong;
avoiding the accustomed ceremonies and festivals.

[.numbered]
XII.
Their burials are performed with the same simplicity.
If the body of the deceased be near any public meeting-place,
it is usually carried thither for the more convenient reception
of those who accompany it to the burying ground.
And it so falls out sometimes, that while the meeting is gathering for the burial,
some one or other has a word of exhortation,
for the sake of the people there met together:
after which the body is borne away by young men,
or else those that are of the neighbourhood,
or those that were most of the intimacy of the deceased party:
the corpse being in a plain coffin, without any covering or furniture upon it.
At the ground, they pause some time before they put the body into its grave,
that if any there should have any thing upon them to exhort the people,
they may not be disappointed:
and that the relations may the more retiredly and solemnly
take their last leave of the body of their departed kindred,
and the spectators have a sense of mortality,
by the occasion then given them to reflect upon their own latter end.
Otherwise, they have no set rites or ceremonies on those occasions.
Neither do the kindred of the deceased ever wear mourning;
they looking upon it as a worldly ceremony and piece of pomp;
and that what mourning is fit for a Christian to
have at the departure of a beloved relation or friend,
should be worn in the mind, which is only sensible of the loss:
and the love they had to them, and remembrance of them,
to be outwardly expressed by a respect to their advice,
and care of those they have left behind them, and their love of what they loved.
Which conduct of theirs, though unmodish or unfashionable, leaves nothing;
of the substance of things neglected or undone: and as they aim at no more,
so that simplicity of life is what they observe with great satisfaction;
though it sometimes happens not to be without the
mockeries of the vain world they live in.

====

These things, to be sure,
gave them a rough and disagreeable appearance with the generality;
who thought them turners of the world upside down, as indeed, in some sense they were:
but in no other than that wherein Paul was so charged, viz:
"`To bring things back into their primitive and right order again.`"
For these and such like practices of theirs were not the result of humour,
or for civil distinction, as some have fancied,
but a fruit of the inward sense which God through his holy fear had begotten in them.
They did not consider how to contradict the world,
or distinguish themselves as a party from others; it being none of their business,
as it was not their interest: no,
it was not the result of consultation or a framed design,
by which to declare or recommend schism or novelty.
But God having given them a sight of themselves,
they saw the whole world in the same glass of truth;
and sensibly discerned the affections and passions of men,
and the rise and tendency of things; what it was that gratified the "`lust of the flesh,
the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, which are not of the Father,
but of the world.`"
And from thence sprang,
in the night of darkness and apostacy which hath been over people
through their degradation from the light and Spirit of God,
these and many other vain customs, which are seen by the heavenly day of Christ,
that dawns in the soul, to be either wrong in their original, or by time and abuse,
hurtful in their practice.
And though these things seemed trivial to some,
and rendered these people stingy and conceited in such persons`' opinion,
there was and is more in them, than they were, or are aware of.

It was not very easy to our primitive friends to make themselves sights and spectacles,
and the scorn and derision of the world,
which they easily foresaw must be the consequence
of so unfashionable a conversation in it:
but the wisdom of God was seen in the foolishness of these things: First,
That they discovered the satisfaction and concern which
people had in and for the fashions of this world,
notwithstanding their high pretences to another;
in that any disappointment about them came so very near them,
as that the greatest honesty, virtue, wisdom and ability, were unwelcome without them.
Secondly, It seasonably and profitably divided conversation;
for this making their society uneasy to their relations and acquaintance,
it gave them the opportunity of more retirement and solitude;
wherein they met with better company, even the Lord God their Redeemer;
and grew strong in his love, power and wisdom,
and were thereby better qualified for his service.
And their success abundantly showed it: blessed be the name of the Lord.

And though they were not great and learned in the esteem of this world,
(for then they had not wanted followers upon their own credit and authority) yet they
were generally of the most sober of the several persuasions they were in,
and of the most repute for religion; and many of them of good capacity,
substance and account among men.

And also some among them wanted not for parts, learning or estate: though then,
as of old, not many wise or noble, etc. were called,
or at least received the heavenly call,
because of the cross that attended the profession of it in sincerity.
But neither do parts nor learning make men the better Christians,
though the better orators and disputants;
and it is the ignorance of people about the Divine
gift which causes that vulgar and mischievous mistake.
Theory and practice, speculation and enjoyment, words and life, are two things.
It is the penitent, the reformed, the lowly, the watchful,
the self-denying and holy soul, that is the Christian!
And that frame is the fruit and work of the Spirit, which is the life of Jesus:
whose life, though hid in the fulness of it in God the Father,
is shed abroad in the hearts of them who truly believe, according to their capacity.
O that people did but know this to cleanse them, to circumcise them,
to quicken them and to make them new creatures indeed!
Re-created or regenerated after Christ Jesus unto good works,
that they might live to God, and not to themselves,
and offer up living prayers and living praises to the living God,
through his own living Spirit, in which he is only to be worshipped in this Gospel day.

O that they who read me could but feel me! for my heart is affected with this merciful
visitation of the Father of lights and spirits to this poor nation and the whole world,
through the same testimony.
Why should the inhabitants thereof reject it?
Why should they lose the blessed benefit of it?
Why should they not turn to the Lord with all their hearts, and say from the heart,
Speak, Lord, for now thy poor servants hear!
O that thy will may be done, thy great, thy good and holy will,
in earth as it is in heaven!
Do it in us, do it upon us, do what thou wilt with us; for we are thine,
and desire to glorify thee our Creator, both for that and because thou art our Redeemer;
for thou art redeeming us from the earth, from the vanities and pollutions of it,
to be a peculiar people unto thee.
This were a brave day for England, if so she could say in truth.
But alas! the case is otherwise; for which some of thine inhabitants,
O land of my nativity! have mourned over thee with bitter wailing and lamentation.
Their heads have been indeed as waters, and their eyes as fountains of tears,
because of thy transgression and stiff-neckedness; because thou wilt not hear and fear,
and return to the Rock, even thy Rock, O England! from whence thou art hewn.
But be thou warned, O land of great profession, to receive Him into thy heart.
Behold at that door it is he hath stood so long knocking;
but thou wilt yet have none of him.
O be thou awakened, lest Jerusalem`'s judgments do swiftly overtake thee,
because of Jerusalem`'s sins that abound in thee.
For she abounded in formality, but made void the weighty things of God`'s law,
as thou daily dost.

She withstood the Son of God in the flesh,
and thou resistest the Son of God in the Spirit.
He would have gathered her as an hen gathereth her chickens under her wings,
and she would not; so would he have gathered thee out of thy lifeless profession,
and have brought thee to inherit substance; to have known his power and kingdom:
for which he often knocked within, by his grace and Spirit, and without,
by his servants and witnesses; but on the contrary,
as Jerusalem of old persecuted the manifestation of the Son of God in the flesh,
and crucified him, and whipped and imprisoned his servants; so hast thou,
O land! crucified to thyself afresh the Lord of life and glory,
and done despite to his Spirit of grace; slighting the fatherly visitation,
and persecuting the blessed dispensers of it by thy laws and magistrates:
though they have early and late pleaded with thee in the power and Spirit of the Lord;
in love and meekness, that thou mightest know the Lord, and serve him,
and become the glory of all lands.

But thou hast evilly entreated and requited them,
thou hast set at naught all their counsel, and wouldst have none of their reproof,
as thou shouldst have had.
Their appearance was too strait, and their qualifications were too mean,
for thee to receive them; like the Jews of old, that cried,
Is not this the carpenter`'s son, and are not his brethren among us?
Which of the scribes, of the learned, the orthodox, believe in him?
prophesying their fall in a year or two,
and making and executing severe laws to bring it to pass:
endeavouring to terrify them out of their holy way,
or destroy them for abiding faithful to it.
But thou hast seen how many governments that rose against them,
and determined their downfall, have been overturned and extinguished,
and that they are still preserved, and become a great and considerable people,
among the middle sort of thy numerous inhabitants.
And notwithstanding the many difficulties without and within,
which they have laboured under, since the Lord God Eternal first gathered them,
they are an increasing people; the Lord still adding unto them, in divers parts,
such as shall be saved, if they persevere to the end.
And to thee, O England! they were, and are lifted up as a standard,
and as a city set upon an hill, and to the nations round about thee,
that in their light thou mayst come to see light, even in Christ Jesus,
the light of the world, and therefore thy light and life too,
if thou wouldst but turn from thy many evil ways and receive and obey it.
For in the light of the Lamb must the nations of them that are saved walk,
as the Scripture testifies.

Remember,
O nation of great profession! how the Lord has waited
upon thee since the dawning of reformation,
and the many mercies and judgments by which he has pleaded with thee;
and awake and arise out of thy deep sleep, and yet hear his word in thy heart,
that thou mayst live.

Let not this thy day of visitation pass over thy head,
nor neglect thou so great salvation as is this which is come to thy house,
O England! for why shouldst thou die, O land that God desires to bless?
be assured it is he that has been in the midst of this people, in the midst of thee,
and not a delusion, as thy mistaken teachers have made thee believe.
And this thou shalt find by their marks and fruits,
if thou wilt consider them in the spirit of moderation.

[.old-style]
=== Section III. / Of the qualifications of their Ministry. Eleven marks that it is Christian.

[.numbered-group]
====

[.numbered]
I+++.+++ They were changed men themselves before they went about to change others.
Their hearts were rent as well as their garments changed;
and they knew the power and work of God upon them.
And this was seen by the great alteration it made,
and their stricter course of life and more godly
conversation that immediately followed upon it.

[.numbered]
II. They went not forth, nor preached in their own time or will, but in the will of God:
and spoke not their own studied matter, but as they were opened and moved of his Spirit,
with which they were well acquainted in their own conversion:
which cannot be expressed to carnal men, so as to give them any intelligible account;
for to such it is, as Christ said, like the blowing of the wind,
which no man knows whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth;
yet this proof and seal went along with their ministry,
that many were turned from their lifeless professions, and the evil of their ways,
to an inward and experimental knowledge of God, and an holy life,
as thousands can witness.
And as they freely received what they had to say from the Lord,
so they freely administered it to others.

[.numbered]
III.
The bent and stress of their ministry was conversion to God; regeneration and holiness.
Not schemes of doctrines and verbal creeds, nor new forms of worship;
but a leaving off in religion, the superfluous,
and reducing the ceremonious and formal part, and pressing earnestly the substantial,
the necessary and profitable part to the soul; as all, upon a serious reflection,
must and do acknowledge.

[.numbered]
IV. They directed people to the Spirit of Truth in themselves, though not of themselves,
by which all that they asserted, preached and exhorted others to,
might be wrought in them, and known to them, through experience, to be true;
which is an high and distinguishing mark of the truth of their ministry,
both that they knew what they said, and were not afraid of coming to the test.
For as they were bold from certainty,
so they required conformity upon no human authority, but upon conviction,
and the conviction of this spirit,
which they asserted was in them that they preached unto;
and unto that they directed them,
that they might examine and prove the reality of those things which they affirmed of it,
as to its manifestation and work in man.
And this is more than the many ministers in the world pretend to.
They declare of religion, say many things true in words, of God, Christ, and the Spirit;
of holiness and heaven; that all men should repent and amend their lives,
or they will go to hell, etc,
but which of them all pretend to speak of their own knowledge and experience?
or ever directed to the Holy Divine Spirit, or agent, placed of God in man, to help him;
and how to know it,
and wait to feel its power to work that good and acceptable will of God in them.

Some of them indeed have spoken of the Spirit,
and the operations of it to sanctification, and the performance of worship to God;
but where and how to find it, and wait in it to perform our duty to God,
was yet as a mystery to be declared by this further degree of reformation.
So that this people did not only in words, more than equally press repentance,
conversion and holiness, but did it knowingly and experimentally;
and directed those to whom they preached, to a sufficient Spirit;
and told them where it was, and by what tokens they might know it,
and which way they might experience the power and efficacy of it to their souls`' happiness;
which is more than theory and speculation, upon which most other ministers depend;
for here is certainty;
a bottom upon which man may boldly appear before God in the great day of account.

[.numbered]
V+++.+++ They reached to the inward state and condition of people,
which is an evidence of the virtue of the Spirit of Truth,
and of their ministering from it, and not from their own imaginations, glosses,
or comments upon Scripture.
For nothing reaches the heart, but what is from the heart, or pierces the conscience,
but what comes from a living conscience: insomuch that it hath often happened,
where people have, under secrecy,
revealed their state or condition to some choice friends for advice or ease,
they have been so particularly directed in the ministry of this people,
that they have challenged their friends with discovering their secrets,
and telling their preachers their cases, to whom a word had not been spoken.
Yea, the very thoughts and purposes of the hearts of many have been so plainly detected,
that they have like Nathaniel cried out of this inward appearance of Christ,
Thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel.
And those who have embraced this holy Spirit have found this mark of its truth and Divinity,
which the woman of Samaria did of Christ when in the flesh, to be the Messiah, viz.,
It told them all that ever they had done; showed them their insides,
the most inward secrets of their hearts, and laid judgment to the line,
and righteousness to the plummet;
of which thousands can at this day give in their witness.
So that nothing has been affirmed by this people,
of the power and virtue of this heavenly Spirit,
that such as have turned to it have not found true, and more;
and that one-half had not been told them of what they have seen of the power, purity,
wisdom and goodness of God therein.

[.numbered]
VI. The accomplishments with which this Spirit fitted
even some of the meanest of this people,
for their work and service:
furnishing them with an extraordinary understanding in divine things,
and an admirable fluency and a taking way of expression,
which gave occasion to some to wonder, saying of them, as of their Master,
Is not this such a mechanic`'s son, how came he by this learning?
as from thence others took occasion to suspect and insinuate they were
Jesuits in disguise (who had the reputation of learned men for an age
past) though there was not the least ground of truth for any such reflection;
in that their ministers are known, the places of their abode,
their kindred and education.

VII.
That they came forth low, despised and hated, as the primitive Christians did,
and not by the help of worldly wisdom or power, as former reformations,
in part have done.
But in all things, it may be said, this people were brought forth in the cross;
in a contradiction to the ways, worships, fashions and customs of this world; yea,
against wind and tide, that so no flesh might glory before God.

[.numbered]
VIII.
They could have no design to themselves in this work,
thus to expose themselves to scorn and abuse; to spend and be spent:
leaving wife and children, house and land, and all that can be accounted dear to men,
with their lives in their hands, being daily in jeopardy,
to declare this primitive message, revived in their spirits,
by the good Spirit and power of God, viz.:

That God is light and in him is no darkness at all;
and that he has sent his Son a light into the world,
to enlighten all men in order to salvation;
and that they that say they have fellowship with God and are his children and people,
and yet walk in darkness (viz.,
in disobedience to the light in their consciences) and after the vanity of this world,
they lie and do not the truth.
But that all such as love the light and bring their deeds to it, and walk in the light,
as God is light, the blood of Jesus Christ his Son should cleanse them from all sin.
Thus John 1:19-4. Chap.
iii. 20, 21. 1 John 1:5-7.

[.numbered]
IX. Their known great constancy and patience in suffering for their testimony,
in all the branches of it; and that sometimes unto death, by beatings, bruisings,
long and crowded imprisonments and noisome dungeons:
four of them in New-England dying by the hands of the executioner,
purely for preaching amongst that people:
besides banishments and excessive plunders and sequestrations of their goods and estates,
almost in all parts, not easily to be expressed, and less to have been endured,
but by those who have the support of a good and glorious cause;
refusing deliverance by any indirect ways or means, as often as it was offered to them.

[.numbered]
X+++.+++ That they not only showed no disposition to revenge,
when it was at any time in their power, but forgave their cruel enemies;
showing mercy to those who had none for them.

[.numbered]
XI. Their plainness with those in authority, like the ancient prophets,
not fearing to tell them to their faces, of their private and public sins;
and their prophecies to them of their afflictions and downfall,
when in the top of their glory: also of some national judgments,
as of the plague and fire of London, in express terms,
and likewise particular ones to divers persecutors, which accordingly overtook them,
and were very remarkable in the places where they dwelt,
which in time may be made public for the glory of God.

Thus, reader, thou seest this people in their rise, principles, ministry and progress,
both their general and particular testimony; by which thou mayest be informed how,
and upon what foot, they sprang and became so considerable a people.
It remains next, that I show also their care, conduct and discipline,
as a Christian and reformed Society,
that they might be found living up to their own principles and profession.
And this, the rather,
because they have hardly suffered more in their character
from the unjust charge of error,
than by the false imputation of disorder;
which calumny indeed has not failed to follow all
the true steps that were ever made to reformation,
and under which reproach none suffered more than the primitive Christians themselves,
who were the honour of Christianity,
and the great lights and examples of their own and succeeding ages.

[.old-style]
=== Section IV. / Of the discipline and practice of this people, as a religious Society. The church power they own and exercise, and that which they reject and condemn; with the method of their proceedings against erring and disorderly persons.

This people increasing daily both in town and country,
an holy care fell upon some of the elders among them,
for the benefit and service of the church.
The first business in their view, after the example of the primitive saints,
was the exercise of charity; to supply the necessities of the poor,
and answer the like occasions.
Wherefore collections were early and liberally made
for that and other services in the church,
and entrusted with faithful men, fearing God and of good report,
who were not weary in well-doing; adding often of their own in large proportions,
which they never brought to account or desired should be known,
much less restored to them, that none might want,
nor any service be retarded or disappointed.

They were also very careful that every one who belonged to them
answered their profession in their behaviour among men,
upon all occasions; that they lived peaceably and were in all things good examples.
They found themselves engaged to record their sufferings and services;
and in the case of marriage,
which they could not perform in the usual methods of the nation, but among themselves,
they took care that all things were clear between the parties and all others;
and it was then rare that any one entertained an inclination to a person on that account,
until he or she had communicated it secretly to some
very weighty and eminent Friends among them,
that they might have a sense of the matter;
looking to the counsel and unity of their brethren as of great moment to them.

But because the charge of the poor, the number of orphans, marriages,
sufferings and other matters multiplied,
and that it was good that the churches were in some way
and method of proceeding in such affairs among them,
to the end they might the better correspond upon occasion,
where a member of one meeting might have to do with one of another;
it pleased the Lord in his wisdom and goodness,
to open the understanding of the first instrument of this dispensation of life,
about a good and orderly way of proceeding;
who felt an holy concern to visit the churches in person throughout this nation,
to begin and establish it among them;
and by his epistles the like was done in other nations and provinces abroad,
which he also afterwards visited and helped in that service,
which shall be observed when I come to speak of him.

Now the care, conduct and discipline, I have been speaking of,
and which are now practised among this people, are as followeth:

This godly elder, +++[+++George Fox,]
in every county where he travelled, exhorted them,
that some out of every meeting for worship, should meet together once in the month,
to confer about the wants and occasions of the church.
And as the case required,
so those Monthly Meetings were fewer or more in number in every respective county:
four or six meetings for worship, usually making one Monthly Meeting for business.
And accordingly the brethren met him from place to place, and began the said meetings,
viz., For the poor, orphans, orderly walking, integrity to their profession, births,
marriages, burials, sufferings, etc.
And that these Monthly Meetings should, in each county, make up one Quarterly Meeting,
where the most zealous and eminent Friends of the county should assemble to communicate,
advise and help one another, especially when any business seemed difficult,
or a Monthly Meeting was tender of determining a matter.

Also that these several Quarterly Meetings should
digest the reports of their Monthly Meetings,
and prepare one for each respective county against the Yearly Meeting,
into which all Quarterly Meetings resolve; which is held in London,
where the churches in this nation, and other nations and provinces,
meet by chosen members of their respective counties,
both mutually to communicate their church-affairs, and to advise and be advised,
in any depending case, to edification.
Also to provide a requisite stock for the discharge
of general expenses for general services in the church,
not needful to be here particularized.

At these meetings any of the members of the churches may come, if they please,
and speak their minds freely, in the fear of God, to any matter;
but the mind of each Quarterly Meeting, therein represented, is chiefly understood,
as to particular cases,
in the sense delivered by the persons deputed or
chosen for that service by the said meeting.

During the Yearly Meeting, to which the other meetings refer in their order,
and naturally resolve themselves, care is taken by a select number for that service,
chosen by the general assembly, to draw up the minutes of the said meeting,
upon the several matters that have been under consideration therein, to the end,
that the respective Quarterly and Monthly Meetings may be informed of all proceedings;
together with a general exhortation to holiness, unity and charity.
Of all which proceedings in the Yearly, Quarterly, and Monthly Meetings,
due record is kept by some one appointed for that service,
or who hath voluntarily undertaken it.
These meetings are opened, and usually concluded, in solemn waiting upon God,
who is sometimes graciously pleased to answer them
with as signal evidences of his love and presence,
as in any of their meetings for worship.

It is further to be noted, that in these solemn assemblies for the churches`' service,
there is no one presides among them after the manner of the assemblies of other people;
Christ only being their president,
as He is pleased to appear in life and wisdom in any one or more of them; to whom,
whatever be their capacity or degree, the rest adhere with a firm unity,
not of authority, but conviction,
which is the Divine authority and way of Christ`'s power and spirit in his people:
making good his blessed promise, that he would be in the midst of his,
where and whenever they were met together in his name, even to the end of the world.
So be it.

Now it may be expected I should here set down what
sort of authority is exercised by this people,
upon such members of their Society as correspond not in their lives with their profession,
and who are refractory to this good and wholesome order settled among them;
and the rather,
because they have not wanted their reproach and sufferings from some tongues and pens,
upon this occasion, in a plentiful manner.

The power they exercise, is such as Christ has given to his own people,
to the end of the world, in the persons of his disciples, viz., To oversee, exhort,
reprove, and after long suffering and waiting upon the disobedient and refractory,
to disown them, as being any more of their communion,
or that they will any longer stand charged in the sight and judgment of God or men,
with their conversation or behaviour, as of them, until they repent.
The subject matter about which this authority,
in any of the foregoing branches of it is exercised; is first,
in relation to common and general practice; and, secondly,
about those things that more strictly refer to their own character and profession,
and which distinguish them from all other professors of Christianity;
avoiding two extremes upon which many split, viz., Persecution and libertinism; that is,
a coercive power, to whip people into the temple; that such as will not conform,
though against faith and conscience, shall be punished in their persons or estates:
or leaving all loose and at large, as to practice,
and so unaccountable to all but God and the magistrate.
To which hurtful extreme, nothing has more contributed than the abuse of church power,
by such as suffer their passions and private interests to prevail with them to carry
it to outward force and corporal punishment--a practice they have been taught to dislike,
by their extreme sufferings,
as well as their known principle for an universal liberty of conscience.

On the other hand, they equally dislike an independency in society;
an unaccountableness in practice and conversation,
to the rules and terms of their own communion, and to those that are the members of it.
They distinguish between imposing any practice that immediately regards faith or worship,
(which is never to be done or suffered,
or submitted unto) and requiring Christian compliance with those methods
that only respect church-business in its more civil part and concern;
and that regard the discreet and orderly maintenance of
the character of the Society as a sober and religious community.
In short, what is for the promotion of holiness and charity,
that men may practise what they profess, live up to their own principles,
and not be at liberty to give the lie to their own profession without rebuke,
is their use and limit of church power.
They compel none to join them, but oblige those that are of them to walk suitably,
or they are denied by them: that is all the mark they set upon them,
and the power they exercise, or judge a Christian Society can exercise,
upon those that are members of it.

The way of their proceeding against such as have lapsed or transgressed, is this:
He is visited by some of them, and the matter of fact is laid home to him,
be it any evil practice against known and general virtue,
or any breach of their particular testimony, which he in common, professeth with them.
They labour with him in much love and zeal, for the good of his soul,
the honour of God and reputation of their profession, to own his fault and condemn it,
in as ample a manner as the evil or scandal was given by him;
which for the most part is performed by some written testimony under the party`'s hand:
and if it so happen, that the party prove refractory,
and is not willing to clear the truth they profess,
from the reproach of his or her evil doing or unfaithfulness, they,
after repeated entreaties and due waiting for a token of repentance,
give forth a paper to disown such a fact and the party offending;
recording the same as a testimony of their care for the honour of the Truth they profess.

And if he or she shall clear their profession and themselves,
by sincere acknowledgment of their fault and godly sorrow,
they are received and looked upon again as members of their communion.
For as God, so his true people, upbraid no man after repentance.

This is the account I have to give of the people of God called Quakers, as to their rise,
appearance, principles and practices in this age of the world,
both with respect to their faith and worship, discipline and conversation.
And I judge it very proper in this place,
because it is to preface the journal of the first
blessed and glorious instrument of this work,
and for a testimony to him in his singular qualifications and services,
in which he abundantly excelled in his day,
and are worthy to be set forth as an example to all succeeding times,
to the glory of the Most High God,
and for a just memorial to that worthy and excellent man,
his faithful servant and apostle to this generation of the world.

[.old-style]
=== Section V. / Of the first instrument or person by whom God was pleased to gather this people into the way they profess. His many excellent qualifications; showing a Divine, and not an human power, to have been their original in him. His troubles and sufferings both from without and within. His end and triumph.

I am now come to the third head or branch of my preface, viz., The instrumental author.
For it is natural for some to say, well, here are the people and work,
but where and who was the man, the instrument?
He that in this age was sent to begin this work and people?
I shall, as God shall enable me, declare who and what he was;
not only by report of others,
but from my own long and most inward converse and intimate knowledge of him;
for which my soul blesseth God, as it hath often done.
And I doubt not, but by the time I have discharged myself of this part of my preface,
my serious readers will believe I had good cause so to do.

The blessed instrument of it, in this day of God, and of whom I am now about to write,
was George Fox, distinguished from another of that name,
by that other`'s addition of younger to his name, in all his writings;
not that he was so in years, but that he was so in the Truth.
But he was also a worthy man, witness and servant of God in his time.

George Fox was born in Leicestershire, about the year 1624.
He descended of honest and sufficient parents, who endeavoured to bring him up,
as they did the rest of their children, in the way and worship of the nation.
Especially his mother,
who was a woman accomplished above most of her degree in the place where she lived.
But from a child he appeared of another frame of mind than the rest of his brethren;
being more religious, inward, still, solid and observing, beyond his years,
as the answers he would give and the questions he would put, upon occasion,
manifested to the astonishment of those who heard him, especially in Divine things.

His mother taking notice of his singular temper, and the gravity,
wisdom and piety that very early shined through him,
refusing childish and vain sports and company, when very young,
was tender and indulgent over him, so that from her he met with little difficulty.
As to his employment, he was brought up in country business,
and as he took most delight in sheep, so he was very skilful in them;
an employment that very well suited his mind in several respects,
both for its innocency and solitude;
and was a just emblem of his after ministry and service.

I shall not break in upon his own account, which is by much the best that can be given;
and therefore desire, what I can, to avoid saying any thing of what is said already,
as to the particular passages of his coming forth.
When he was somewhat above twenty, he left his friends,
and visited the most retired and religious people in those parts; and some there were,
in this nation, who wailed for the consolation of Israel, night and day, as Zacharias,
Anna and good old Simeon did of old time.
To these he was sent, and these he sought out in the neighbouring counties,
and among them he sojourned, until his more ample ministry came upon him.
At this time he taught, and was an example, of silence,
endeavouring to bring them from self-performances;
testifying of and turning them to the light of Christ within them,
and encouraging them to wait in patience,
and to feel the power of it stir in their hearts,
that their knowledge and worship of God might stand in the power of an endless life,
which was to be found in the light, as it was obeyed, in the manifestation of it in man.
For in the Word was life, and that life is the light of men.
Life in the Word, light in men, and life in men too, as the light is obeyed.
The children of the light living by the life of the Word,
by which the Word begets them again to God, which is the regeneration and new birth,
without which there is no coming into the kingdom of God: to which whoever comes,
is greater than John; that is, than John`'s dispensation,
which was not that of the kingdom, but the consummation of the legal,
and fore-runner of the Gospel times, the time of the kingdom.
Accordingly several meetings were gathered in those parts;
and thus his time was employed for some years.

In 1652, he being in his usual retirement, his mind exercised towards the Lord,
upon a very high mountain, in some of the hither parts of Yorkshire, as I take it,
he had a vision of the great work of God in the earth,
and of the way that he was to go forth in a public ministry, to begin it.
He saw people as thick as motes in the sun,
that should in time be brought home to the Lord,
that there might be but one Shepherd and one sheepfold in all the earth.
Then his eye was directed northward,
beholding a great people that should receive him and his message in those parts.
Upon this mountain he was moved of the Lord to sound out his great and notable day,
as if he had been in a great auditory; and from thence went north,
as the Lord had shown him.
In every place where he came, if not before he came to it,
he had his particular exercise and service shown to him,
so that the Lord was his leader indeed.
For it was not in vain that he travelled;
God in most places sealing his commission with the convincement of some of all sorts,
as well publicans as sober professors of religion.

Some of the first and most eminent of those who came forth in a public ministry,
and who are now at rest, were Richard Farnsworth, James Nayler, William Dewsberry,
Thomas Aldam, Francis Howgil, Edward Burroughs, John Camm, John Audland,
Richard Hubberthom, T. Taylor, T. Holmes, Alexander Parker, William Simson,
William Caton, John Stubbs, Robert Withers, Thomas Loe, Josiah Coale, John Burnyeat,
Robert Lodge, Thomas Salthouse, and many more worthies, that cannot be well here named;
together with divers yet living of the first and great convincement.
These, after the knowledge of God`'s purging judgment in themselves,
and some time of waiting in silence upon him,
to feel and receive power from on high to speak in his name, which none else rightly can,
though they may use the same words; they felt its Divine motions,
and were frequently drawn forth, especially to visit the public assemblies, to reprove,
inform and exhort them.
Sometimes in markets, fairs, streets and by the highway side,
calling people to repentance,
and to turn to the Lord with their hearts as well as their mouths;
directing them to the light of Christ within them, by which to see,
examine and consider their ways, and to eschew evil,
and do the good and acceptable will of God.
And they suffered great hardships for this their love and good-will; being often stocked,
stoned, beaten, whipped and imprisoned, though honest men,
and of good report where they lived; who had left wives, children, houses and lands,
to visit them with a living call to repentance.
And though the priests generally set themselves to oppose them, and wrote against them,
and insinuated most false and scandalous stories to defame them,
stirring up the magistrates to suppress them, especially in those northern parts;
yet God was pleased so to fill them with his living power,
and to give them such an open door of utterance in his service,
that there was a mighty convincement over those parts.

Through the tender and singular indulgence of Judge Bradshaw, Judge Fell,
and Colonel West, in the infancy of things,
the priests were never able to gain the point they laboured for,
which was to proceed to blood; and if possible, Herod-like,
by a cruel exercise of the civil power, to have cut them off,
and rooted them out of the country.
But especially Judge Fell,
who was not only a check to their rage in the course of legal proceedings,
but otherwise upon occasion, and finally countenanced this people.
For his wife receiving the Truth with the first, it had that influence upon his spirit,
being a just and wise man,
and seeing in his own wife and family a full confutation
of all the popular clamours against the way of Truth,
he covered them what he could, and freely opened his doors,
and gave up his house to his wife and her friends;
not valuing the reproach of ignorant or evil-minded people;
which I here mention to his and her honour, and which will be, I believe,
an honour and a blessing to such of their name and family,
as shall be found in that tenderness, humility,
love and zeal for the Truth and people of the Lord.

That house was for some years at first,
especially till the Truth had opened its way into the southern parts of this island,
an eminent receptacle of this people.
Others of good note and substance in those northern counties, also opened their houses,
together with their hearts, to the many publishers, who, in a short time,
the Lord raised to declare his salvation to the people;
and where meetings of the Lord`'s messengers were frequently held,
to communicate their services and exercises,
and comfort and edify one another in their blessed ministry.

But lest this may be thought a digression, having touched upon this before,
I return to this excellent man; and for his personal qualities, natural,
moral and divine, as they appeared in his converse with the brethren,
and in the church of God, take as follows:

[.numbered-group]
====

[.numbered]
I+++.+++ He was a man whom God endued with a clear and wonderful depth;
a discerner of other`'s spirits, and very much a master of his own.
And though that side of his understanding which lay next to the world,
and especially the expression of it, might sound uncouth and unfashionable to nice ears,
his matter was nevertheless very profound,
and would not only bear to be often considered, but the more it was so,
the more weighty and instructing it appeared.
And as abruptly and brokenly as sometimes his sentences would seem to fall from him,
about divine things,
it is well known they were often as texts to many fairer declarations.
And indeed, it showed beyond all contradiction, that God sent him,
in that no art or parts had any share in the matter or manner of his ministry;
and that so many great,
excellent and necessary truths as he came forth to preach to mankind,
had therefore nothing of man`'s wit or wisdom to recommend them.
So that as to man he was an original, being no man`'s copy.
His ministry and writings show that they are from one who was not taught of man,
nor had learned what he said by study.

Nor were they notional or speculative, but sensible and practical truths,
tending to conversion and regeneration,
and the setting up of the kingdom of God in the hearts of men;
and the way of it was his work.
I have many times been overcome in myself, and been made to say, with my Lord and Master,
upon the like occasion, "`I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and revealed them to babes.`"
For my soul hath bowed in humble thankfulness to the Lord,
that he did not choose any of the wise and learned of this world
to be the first messenger in our age of his blessed truth to men;
but that he took one who was not of high degree, nor elegant speech,
nor learned after the way of this world, that his message and work,
which he sent him to do,
might come with less suspicion or jealousy of human wisdom and interest,
and with more force and clearness upon the consciences of those
that sincerely sought the way of Truth in the love of it.
I say, beholding with the eye of my mind, which the God of heaven had opened in me,
the marks of God`'s finger and hand visibly in this testimony,
from the clearness of the principle, the power and efficacy of it,
in the exemplary sobriety, plainness, zeal, steadiness, humility, gravity, punctuality,
charity and circumspect care in the government of church affairs,
which shined in his and their life and testimony whom God employed in this work,
it greatly confirmed me that it was of God, and engaged my soul in a deep love, fear,
reverence and thankfulness for his love and mercy therein to mankind:
in which mind I remain, and shall, I hope, through the Lord`'s strength,
to the end of my days.

[.numbered]
II. In his testimony or ministry,
he much laboured to open Truth to the people`'s understandings,
and to bottom them upon the principle and principal, Christ Jesus the light of the world;
that by bringing them to that Spirit which is from God in themselves,
they might the better know and judge of him and themselves.

[.numbered]
III.
He had an extraordinary gift in opening the Scriptures.
He would go to the marrow of things, and show the mind,
harmony and fulfilling of them with much plainness, and to great comfort and edification.

[.numbered]
IV. The mystery of the first and second Adam, of the fall and restoration,
of the law and Gospel, and shadows and substance, of the servant`'s and Son`'s state,
and the fulfilling of the Scriptures in Christ and by Christ, the true light,
in all that are his, through the obedience of faith,
were much of the substance and drift of his testimonies.
In all which he was witnessed to be of God;
being sensibly felt to speak that which he had received of Christ,
and was his own experience, in that which never errs or fails.

[.numbered]
V+++.+++ But above all, he excelled in prayer.
The inwardness and weight of his spirit,
the reverence and solemnity of his address and behaviour,
and the fewness and fulness of his words,
have often struck even strangers with admiration,
as they used to reach others with consolation.
The most awful, living, reverent frame I ever felt or beheld, I must say,
was his in prayer.
And truly it was a testimony that he knew and lived nearer to the Lord than other men;
for they that know him most,
will see most reason to approach him with reverence and fear.

[.numbered]
VI. He was of an innocent life, no busybody, nor self-seeker;
neither touchy nor critical: what fell from him was very inoffensive,
if not very edifying.
So meek, contented, modest, easy, steady, tender, it was a pleasure to be in his company.
He exercised no authority but over evil, and that everywhere, and in all; but with love,
compassion, and long suffering.
A most merciful man, as ready to forgive, as unapt to take or give an offence.
Thousands can truly say he was of an excellent spirit and savour among them,
and because thereof,
the most excellent spirits loved him with an unfeigned and unfading love.

[.numbered]
VII.
He was an incessant labourer: for in his younger time, before his many,
great and deep sufferings and travels had enfeebled his body for itinerant services,
he laboured much in the word and doctrine, and discipline, in England,
Scotland and Ireland; turning many to God,
and confirming those who were convinced of the Truth, and settling good order,
as to church affairs, among them.
And towards the conclusion of his travelling services, between the years 1671 and 1677,
he visited the churches of Christ in the plantations in America,
and in the United Provinces, and Germany, as his journal relates;
to the convincement and consolation of many.
After that time he chiefly resided in and about the city of London.
And besides his labour in the ministry, which was frequent and serviceable,
he wrote much, both to them that are within, and to those who are without the communion.
But the care he took of the affairs of the church in general was very great.

[.numbered]
VIII.
He was often where the records of the business of the church are kept,
and where the letters from the many meetings of God`'s
people over all the world use to come:
which letters he had read to him,
and communicated them to the meeting that is held weekly for such services:
and he would be sure to stir them up to answer them, especially in suffering cases;
showing great sympathy and compassion upon all such occasions;
carefully looking into the respective cases, and endeavouring speedy relief,
according to the nature of them.
So that the churches, or any of the suffering members thereof,
were sure not to be forgotten nor delayed in their desires, if he were there.

[.numbered]
IX. As he was unwearied, so he was undaunted in his services for God and his people;
he was no more to be moved to fear than to wrath.
His behaviour at Derby, Litchfield, Appleby, before Oliver Cromwell, at Launceston,
Scarborough, Worcester, and Westminster-hall, with many other places and exercises,
did abundantly evidence it, to his enemies as well as to his friends.

====

But as in the primitive times,
some rose up against the blessed apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ,
even from among those whom they had turned to the hope of the Gospel,
and became their greatest trouble;
so this man of God had his share of suffering from some who were convinced by him, who,
through prejudice or mistake, ran against him,
as one that sought dominion over conscience,
because he pressed by his presence or epistles,
a ready and zealous compliance with such good and wholesome things as
tended to an orderly conversation about the affairs of the church,
and in their walking before men.
That which contributed much to this ill work was, in some,
a grudging of this meek man the love and esteem he
had and deserved in the hearts of the people;
and weakness in others,
who were taken with their groundless suggestions of imposition and blind obedience.

They would have had every man independent, that as he had the Spirit of Truth in himself,
he should only stand or fall to that, and no body else;
not considering that it is one in all;
and though the measure of light or grace might differ, yet the nature of it was the same;
and being so, they struck at the spiritual unity, which a people,
guided by the same Spirit, are naturally led into: so that what is an evil to one,
is so to all, and what is virtuous, honest, and of good repute to one, is so to all,
from the sense and savour of the one universal Spirit which is common to all,
and which the disaffected also profess to be the root of all true Christian fellowship,
and that spirit into which the people of God drink, and come to be spiritually minded,
and of one heart and one soul.

Some ignorantly mistook good order in the government of church affairs,
for discipline in worship,
and that it was so pressed or recommended by him and other brethren.
And thereupon they were ready to reflect the same things that dissenters
had very reasonably objected upon the national churches,
which have coercively pressed conformity to their respective creeds and worships.
Whereas these things related wholly to conversation, and the outward, and as I may say,
civil part of the church; that men should walk up to the principles of their belief,
and not be wanting in care and charity.
But though some have stumbled and fallen through mistakes,
and an unreasonable obstinacy even to a prejudice; yet blessed be God,
the generality have returned to their first love, and seen the work of the enemy,
who loses no opportunity or advantage by which he may check or hinder the work of God,
and disquiet the peace of his church, and chill the love of his people to the Truth,
and one to another; and there is hope of divers of the few who yet are at a distance.

In all these occasions, though there was no person the discontented struck so sharply at,
as this good man, he bore all their weakness and prejudice,
and returned not reflection for reflection;
but forgave them their weak and bitter speeches, praying for them,
that they might have a sense of their hurt,
and see the subtlety of the enemy to rend and divide,
and return to their first love which thought no ill.

And truly I must say,
that though God had visibly clothed him with a divine preference and authority,
and indeed his very presence expressed a religious majesty, yet he never abused it:
but held his place in the church of God with great meekness,
and a most engaging humility and moderation.
For upon all occasions, like his blessed Master, he was a servant to all;
holding and exercising his eldership in the invisible power that had gathered them,
with reverence to the Head and care over the body: and was received,
only in that spirit and power of Christ, as the first and chief elder in this age: who,
as he was therefore worthy of double honour,
so for the same reason it was given by the faithful of this day;
because his authority was inward and not outward,
and that he got it and kept it by the love of God, and power of an endless life.
I write my knowledge, and not report, and my witness is true;
having been with him for weeks and months together on divers occasions,
and those of the nearest and most exercising nature; and that by night and by day,
by sea and by land; in this and foreign countries; and I can say,
I never saw him out of his place, or not a match for every service or occasion.

For in all things he acquitted himself like a man, yea, a strong man,
a new and heavenly-minded man, a divine and a naturalist,
and all of God Almighty`'s making.
I have been surprised at his questions and answers in natural things;
that whilst he was ignorant of useless and sophistical science,
he had in him the grounds of useful and commendable knowledge,
and cherished it everywhere: civil beyond all forms of breeding, in his behaviour;
very temperate, eating little and sleeping less, though a bulky person.

Thus he lived and sojourned among us: and as he lived so he died;
feeling the same eternal power that had raised and preserved him, in his last moments.
So full of assurance was he, that he triumphed over death:
and so even in his spirit to the last, as if death were hardly worth notice,
or a mention: recommending to some of us who were with him,
the dispatch and dispersion of an epistle just before given
forth by him to the churches of Christ throughout the world,
and his own books: but above all, Friends; and of all Friends,
those in Ireland and America, twice over, saying,
mind poor Friends in Ireland and America.

And to some who came in and inquired how he found himself, he answered, never heed,
the Lord`'s power is over all weakness and death; the Seed reigns, blessed be the Lord:
which was about four or five hours before his departure out of this world.
He was at the great meeting near Lombard street, on the first-day of the week,
and it was the third-day following, about ten o`'clock at night, when he left us;
being at the house of Henry Goldney, in the same court.
In a good old age he went,
after having lived to see his children`'s children in the Truth to many generations.
He had the comfort of a short illness, and the blessing of a clear sense to the last:
and we may truly say, with a man of God of old, that being dead, he yet speaketh;
and though now absent in body, he is present in spirit:
neither time nor place being able to interrupt the communion of saints,
or dissolve the fellowship of the spirits of the just.
His works praise him, because they are to the praise of Him who wrought by him;
for which his memorial is and shall be blessed.
I have done, as to this part of my preface,
when I have left this short epitaph to his name,
"`Many sons have done virtuously in this day; but dear George, thou excellest them all.`"

=== Section VI. / Containing five several exhortations. First, general, reminding this people of their primitiveintegrity and simplicity. Secondly, in particular, to the ministry. Thirdly, to the young convinced. Fourthly, to the children of Friends. Fifthly, to those that are yet strangers to this people and way; to whom this book, (and that to which it was a preface in its former edition) may come. All the several exhortations accommodated to their several states and conditions; that all may answer the end of God`'s glory and their own salvation.

And now, friends,
you that profess to walk in the way that this blessed
man was sent of God to turn us into,
suffer, I beseech you, the word of exhortation, as well fathers as children,
and elders as young men.
The glory of this day,
and foundation of the hope that has not made us ashamed since we were a people,
you know is that blessed light and life of Christ which we profess,
and direct all people to,
as the great and divine instrument and agent of man`'s conversion to God.
It was by this that we were first touched and effectually enlightened,
as to our inward state; which put us upon the consideration of our latter end;
causing us to set the Lord before our eyes, and to number our days,
that we might apply our hearts to wisdom.
In that day we judged not after the sight of the eye, nor after the hearing of the ear;
but according to the light and sense this blessed Spirit gave us,
so we judged and acted in reference to things and persons, ourselves and others; yea,
towards God our maker.
For being quickened by it in our inward man,
we could easily discern the difference of things, and feel what was right,
and what was wrong, and what was fit, and what not,
both in reference to religious and civil concerns.
That being the ground of the fellowship of all saints,
it was in that our fellowship stood.
In this we desired to have a sense of one another, acted towards one another,
and all men, in love, faithfulness and fear.

In feeling the stirrings and motions of this Spirit in our hearts,
we drew near to the Lord, and waited to be prepared by it,
that we might feel its drawings and movings before we approached the Lord in prayer,
or opened our mouths in ministry.
And in our beginning and ending with this, stood our comfort, service and edification.
And as we ran faster or fell short, in our services,
we made burdens for ourselves to bear;
finding in ourselves a rebuke instead of an acceptance; and in lieu of well-done,
Who has required this at your hands?

In that day we were an exercised people, our very countenances and deportment declared it.
Care for others was then much upon us, as well as for ourselves;
especially of the young convinced.
Often had we the burden of the word of the Lord to our neighbours,
relations and acquaintance; and sometimes strangers also.
We were in travail likewise for one another`'s preservation; not seeking,
but shunning occasions of any coldness or misunderstanding;
treating one another as those who believed and felt God present;
which kept our conversation innocent, serious and weighty;
guarding ourselves against the cares and friendships of the world.

We held the truth in the spirit of it, and not in our own spirits,
or after our own wills and affections: they were bowed and brought into subjection,
insomuch that it was visible to those who knew us,
that we did not think ourselves at our own disposal, to go where we listed,
nor to say or do what we listed nor when we listed.
Our liberty stood in the liberty of the Spirit of truth; and no pleasure, no profit,
no favour could draw us from this retired, strict and watchful frame.
We were so far from seeking occasions of company, that we avoided them what we could;
pursuing our own business with moderation,
instead of meddling with other people`'s unnecessarily.

Our words were few and savoury, our looks composed and weighty,
and our whole deportment very observable.
True it is,
that this retired and strict sort of life from the
liberty of the conversation of the world,
exposed us to the censures of many as humourists, conceited and self-righteous persons, etc.
But it was our preservation from many snares, to which others were continually exposed,
by the prevalency of the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life,
that wanted no occasions or temptations to excite them,
abroad in the converse of the world.

I cannot forget the humility and chaste zeal of that day.
O, how constant at meetings, how retired in them, how firm to truth`'s life,
as well as truth`'s principles! and how entire and united in our communion,
as indeed became those who profess one head, even Christ Jesus the Lord.

This being the testimony and example the man of God, before-mentioned,
was sent to declare and leave amongst us,
and we having embraced the same as the merciful visitation of God to us,
the word of exhortation at this time is,
That we continue to be found in the way of this testimony, with all zeal and integrity,
and so much the more, by how much the day draweth near.

And first, as to you my beloved and much honoured brethren in Christ,
who are in the exercise of the ministry; O,
feel life in your ministry! let life be your commission,
your well-spring and treasury on all such occasions; else you well know,
there can be no begetting to God, since nothing can quicken or make people alive to God,
but the life of God: and it must be a ministry in and from life,
that enlivens any people to God.
We have seen the fruit of all other ministries,
by the few that are turned from the evil of their ways.
It is not our parts, or memory, or the repetition of former openings,
in our own will and time, that will do God`'s work.
A dry doctrinal ministry, however sound in words, can reach but the ear,
and is but a dream at the best: there is another soundness, that is soundest of all,
viz. Christ the power of God.
He is the key of David, that opens and none shuts, and shuts, and none can open;
as the oil to the lamp, and the soul to the body, so is that to the best of words:
which made Christ to say, My words, they are Spirit and they are life; that is,
they are from life, and therefore they make you alive that receive them.
If the disciples, who had lived with Jesus, were to stay at Jerusalem,
until they received it, much more must we wait to receive before we minister,
if we will turn people from darkness to light, and from Satan`'s power to God.

I fervently bow my knees to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
that you may always be like-minded, that you may ever wait reverently,
for the coming and opening of the Word of life,
and attend upon it in your ministry and service, that you may serve God in his spirit.
And be it little or be it much, it is well; for much is not too much,
and the least is enough, if from the motion of God`'s Spirit; and without it, verily,
ever so little is too much, because to no profit.

For it is the Spirit of the Lord immediately, or through the ministry of his servants,
that teacheth his people to profit; and to be sure,
so far as we take him along with us in our services,
so far we are profitable and no further.
For if it be the Lord that must work all things in us for our salvation,
much more is it the Lord that must work in us for the conversion of others.
If therefore it was once a cross to us to speak,
though the Lord required it at our hands, let it never be so to be silent,
when he does not.

It is one of the most dreadful sayings in the book of God,
That he that adds to the words of the prophecy of this book,
God will add to him the plagues written in this book.
To keep back the counsel of God is as terrible;
for he that takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy,
God shall take away his part out of the book of life.
And truly, it has great caution in it, to those that use the name of the Lord,
to be well assured the Lord speaks,
that they may not be found of the number of those
who add to the words of the testimony of prophecy,
which the Lord giveth them to bear; nor yet to mince or diminish the same,
both being so very offensive to God.

Wherefore, brethren, let us be careful neither to out-go our Guide,
nor yet to loiter behind him; since he that makes haste, may miss his way,
and he that stays behind, lose his guide.
For even those who have received the word of the Lord, had need to wait for wisdom,
that they may see how to divide the word aright: which plainly implieth,
that it is possible for one who has received the word of the Lord,
to miss in the dividing and application of it,
which must come from an impatience of spirit, and a self-working,
which makes an unsound and dangerous mixture,
and will hardly beget a right-minded living people to God.

I am earnest in this above all other considerations, as to public brethren;
well knowing how much it concerns the present and future
state and preservation of the church of Christ Jesus,
that has been gathered and built up by a living and powerful ministry,
that the ministry be held, preserved, and continued in the manifestations,
motions and supplies of the same life and power, from time to time.

And wherever it is observed, that any do minister more from gifts and parts,
than life and power, though they have an enlightened and doctrinal understanding,
let them in time be advised and admonished for their preservation;
because insensibly such will come to depend upon a self-sufficiency,
to forsake Christ the living fountain,
and hew out unto themselves cisterns that will hold no living water.
By degrees,
such will come to draw others from waiting upon the gift of God in themselves,
and to feel it in others, in order to their strength and refreshment, to wait upon them,
and to turn from God to man again,
and so make shipwreck of the faith once delivered to the saints,
and of a good conscience towards God; which are only kept by that Divine gift of life,
that begat the one, and awakened and sanctified the other in the beginning.

Nor is it enough, that we have known the Divine gift,
and in it have reached to the spirits in prison,
and been the instruments of the convincing of others of the way of God,
if we keep not as low and poor in ourselves, and as depending upon the Lord, as ever:
since no memory, no repetitions of former openings, revelations or enjoyments,
will bring a soul to God, or afford bread to the hungry, or water to the thirsty,
unless life go with what we say, and that must be waited for.

O that we may have no other fountain, treasure or dependence!
That none may presume at any rate to act of themselves for God,
because they have long acted from God; that we may not supply want of waiting,
with our own wisdom,
or think that we may take less care and more liberty in speaking than formerly;
and that where we do not feel the Lord, by his power, to open us and enlarge us,
whatever be the expectation of the people,
or has been our customary supply and character,
we may not exceed or fill up the time with our own.

I hope we shall ever remember, who it was that said,
"`Of yourselves ye can do nothing;`" our sufficiency is in Him.
And if we are not to speak our own words,
nor take thought what we should say to men in our defence when exposed for our testimony,
surely we ought to speak none of our own words,
nor take thought what we shall say in our testimony and ministry,
in the name of our Lord, to the souls of the people; for then of all times,
and of all other occasions, should it be fulfilled in us, "`for it is not you that speak,
but the Spirit of my Father that speaketh in you.`"

And indeed,
the ministry of the Spirit must and does keep its
analogy and agreement with the birth of the Spirit;
that as no man can inherit the kingdom of God, unless he be born of the Spirit,
so no ministry can beget a soul to God, but that which is from the Spirit: for this,
as I said before, the disciples waited before they went forth; and in this,
our elder brethren, and messengers of God in our day, waited, visited, and reached to us;
and having begun in the Spirit,
let none ever hope or seek to be made perfect in the flesh;
for what is the flesh to the Spirit, or the chaff`' to the wheat?
If we keep in the Spirit, we shall keep in the unity of it,
which is the ground of true fellowship.
For by drinking into that one Spirit, we are made one people to God,
and by it we are continued in the unity of the faith, and the bond of peace.

No envying, no bitterness, no strife, can have place with us.
We shall watch always for good, and not for evil, one over another,
and rejoice exceedingly,
and not grudge at one another`'s increase in the riches of the
grace with which God replenisheth his faithful servants.

And brethren, as to you is committed the dispensation of the oracles of God,
which gives you frequent opportunities,
and great place with the people among whom you travel,
I beseech you that you would not think it sufficient
to declare the word of life in their assemblies,
however edifying and comfortable such opportunities may be to you and them: but,
as was the practice of the man of God before mentioned, in great measure, when among us,
inquire the state of the several churches you visit;
who among them are afflicted or sick, who are tempted,
and if any are unfaithful or obstinate;
and endeavour to issue those things in the wisdom and power of God,
which will be a glorious crown upon your ministry.
As that prepares your way in the hearts of the people, to receive you as men of God,
so it gives you credit with them to do them good by your advice in other respects;
the afflicted will be comforted by you, the tempted strengthened, the sick refreshed,
the unfaithful convicted and restored, and such as are obstinate,
softened and fitted for reconciliation; which is clinching the nail,
and applying and fastening the general testimony,
by this particular care of the several branches of it,
in reference to them more immediately concerned in it.

For though good and wise men, and elders too, may reside in such places,
who are of worth and importance in the general, and in other places;
yet it does not always follow,
that they may have the room they deserve in the hearts of the people they live among;
or some particular occasion may make it unfit for him or them to use that authority.
But you that travel as God`'s messengers, if they receive you in the greater,
shall they refuse you in the Jess?
and if they own the general testimony,
can they withstand the particular application of it, in their own cases?
Thus ye will show yourselves workmen indeed, and carry your business before you,
to the praise of his name, who hath called you from darkness to light,
that you might turn others from Satan`'s power unto God and his kingdom, which is within.
And O that there were more of such faithful labourers in the vineyard of the Lord!
Never more need since the day of God.

Wherefore I cannot but cry and call aloud to you,
who have been long professors of the Truth,
and know the Truth in the convincing power of it,
and have had a sober conversation among men,
yet content yourselves only to know truth for yourselves,
to go to meetings and exercise an ordinary charity
in the church and an honest behaviour in the world,
and limit yourselves within these bounds,
feeling little or no concern upon your spirits for the glory
of the Lord in the prosperity of his Truth in the earth,
more than to be glad that others succeed in such service.
Arise ye in the name and power of the Lord Jesus;
behold how white the fields are unto harvest, in this and other nations,
and how few able and faithful labourers there are to work therein!
Your country-folks, neighbours and kindred want to know the Lord and his Truth,
and to walk in it.
Does nothing lie at your door upon their account?
search and see, and lose no time, I beseech you, for the Lord is at hand.

I do not judge you, there is one that judgeth all men, and his judgment is true.
You have mightily increased in your outward substance;
may you equally increase in your inward riches, and do good with both,
while you have a day to do good.
Your enemies would once have taken what you had from you for his name`'s sake,
in whom you have believed; wherefore he has given you much of the world,
in the face of your enemies!
But let it be your servant, and not your master!
Your diversion rather than your business!
Let the Lord be chiefly in your eye, and ponder your ways,
and see if God has nothing more for you to do;
and if you find yourselves short in your account with him, then wait for his preparation,
and be ready to receive the word of command, and be not weary of well-doing,
when you have put your hand to the plough; and assuredly you shall reap,
if you faint not, the fruit of your heavenly labour in God`'s everlasting kingdom.

And you young convinced ones,
be you entreated and exhorted to a diligent and chaste waiting upon God,
and the way of his blessed manifestation and appearance to you.
Look not out, but within: let not another`'s liberty be your snare;
neither act by imitation, but from the sense and feeling of God`'s power in yourselves;
crush not the tender buddings of it in your souls, nor overrun,
in your desires and warmness of affections, the holy and gentle motions of it.
Remember it is a still voice that speaks to us in this day,
and that it is not to be heard in the noises and hurries of the mind,
but is distinctly understood in a retired frame.
Jesus loved and chose solitudes; often going to mountains, gardens and sea-sides,
to avoid crowds and hurries, to show his disciples it was good to be solitary,
and sit loose to the world.
Two enemies lie near your state, imagination and liberty; but the plain, practical,
living, holy Truth, that has convinced you, will preserve you,
if you mind it in yourselves, and bring all thoughts,
inclinations and affections to the test of it, to see if they are wrought in God,
or of the enemy, or of your ownselves; so will a true taste,
discerning and judgment be preserved to you, of what you should do and leave undone.
And in your diligence and faithfulness in this way you will come to inherit substance;
and Christ, the eternal wisdom, will fill your treasury.
And when you are converted as well as convinced, then confirm your brethren;
and be ready to every good word and work, that the Lord shall call you to;
that you may be to his praise, who has chosen you to be partakers,
with the saints in light, of a kingdom that cannot be shaken,
an inheritance incorruptible in eternal habitations.

And now, as for you that are the children of God`'s people,
a great concern is upon my spirit for your good:
and often are my knees bowed to the God of your fathers, for you,
that you may come to be partakers of the same Divine life and power,
that have been the glory of this day; that a generation you may be to God,
an holy nation and a peculiar people, zealous of good works,
when all our heads are laid in the dust.
O, you young men and women! let it not suffice you,
that you are the children of the people of the Lord; you must also be born again,
if you will inherit the kingdom of God.
Your fathers are but such after the flesh,
and could but beget you into the likeness of the first Adam;
but you must be begotten in the likeness of the second Adam, by a spiritual generation,
or you will not, you cannot, be of his children or offspring.
And therefore look carefully about you, O ye children of the children of God!
Consider your standing and see what you are in relation to this Divine kindred,
family and birth.
Have you obeyed the light, and received and walked in the Spirit,
which is the incorruptible seed and word of the kingdom of God,
of which you must be born again.
God is no respecter of persons.
The father cannot save or answer for the child, nor the child for the father,
but in the sin thou sinnest thou shalt die; and in the righteousness thou dost,
through Christ Jesus, thou shalt live;
for it is the willing and obedient that shall eat the good of the land.
Be not deceived, God is not mocked; such as all nations and people sow,
such they shall reap at the hand of the just God.
And then your many and great privileges above the children of other people,
will add weight in the scale against you, if you choose not the way of the Lord.
For you have had line upon line, and precept upon precept, and not only good doctrine,
but good example; and which is more, you have been turned to, and acquainted with,
the Spirit of Truth in yourselves, of which others too generally have been ignorant:
and you know you may be as good as you please, without the fear of frowns and blows,
or being turned out of doors and forsaken of father
and mother for God`'s sake and his holy religion,
as has been the case of some of your fathers,
in the day they first entered into this holy path.
And if you,
after hearing and seeing the wonders which God has
wrought in the deliverance and preservation of them,
through a sea of troubles, and the manifold temporal,
as well as spiritual blessings that he has filled them with,
in the sight of their enemies,
should neglect and turn your backs upon so great and near a salvation,
you would not only be most ungrateful children to God and them,
but must expect that God will call the children of those that knew him not,
to lake the crown out of your hands,
and that your lot will be a dreadful judgment at the hand of the Lord:
but O that it may never be so with any of you.
The Lord forbid, saith my soul.

Wherefore, O ye young men and women, look to the Rock of your fathers:
there is no other God but him, no other light but his, no other grace but his,
nor spirit but his, to convince you, quicken and comfort you; to lead,
guide and preserve you to God`'s everlasting kingdom.
So will you be possessors as well as professors of the Truth, embracing it,
not only by education, but judgment and conviction; from a sense begotten in your souls,
through the operation of the eternal spirit and power of God;
by which you may come to be the seed of Abraham,
through faith and the circumcision not made with hands;
and so heirs of the promise made to the fathers of an incorruptible crown.
That, as I said before, a generation you may be to God,
holding up the profession of the blessed Truth in the life and power of it.
For formality in religion is nauseous to God and good men; and the more so,
where any form or appearance has been new and peculiar
and begun and practised upon principle,
with an uncommon zeal and strictness.
Therefore I say, for you to fall flat and formal, and continue the profession,
without that salt and savour by which it is come to obtain a good report among men,
is not to answer God`'s love, nor your parents`' care,
or the mind of Truth in yourselves, nor in those that are without; who,
though they will not obey the Truth,
have sight and sense enough to see if those who do make a profession of it.
For where the Divine virtue of it is not felt in the soul, and waited for and lived in,
imperfections will quickly break out and show themselves,
and detect the unfaithfulness of such persons,
and that their insides are not seasoned with the
nature of that holy principle which they profess.

Wherefore, dear children,
let me entreat you to shut your eyes at the temptations
and allurements of this low and perishing world,
and not suffer your affections to be captivated by those lusts and vanities,
which your fathers, for the Truth`'s sake, long since turned their backs upon:
but as you believe it to be the truth, receive it into your hearts,
that you may become the children of God: so that it may never be said of you,
as the evangelist writes of the Jews in his time, that Christ,
the true light "`came to his own, but his own received him not:
but to as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the children of God,
which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man,
but of God.`"
A most close and comprehensive passage to this occasion.
You exactly and peculiarly answer to those professing Jews,
in that you bear the name of God`'s people,
by being the children and wearing the form of God`'s people: and he, by his light in you,
may be very well said to come to his own, and if you obey it not,
but turn your backs upon it, and walk after the vanities of your minds,
you will be of those who receive him not,
which I pray God may never be your case and judgment:
but that you may be thoroughly sensible of the many and
great obligations you lie under to the Lord for his love,
and to your parents for their care: and with "`all your heart, and all your soul,
and all your strength, turn to the Lord, to his gift and Spirit in you,
and hear his voice and obey it, that you may seal to the testimony of your fathers,
by the truth and evidence of your own experience;`"
that your children`'s children may bless you,
and the Lord for you, as those that,
delivered a faithful example as well as record of the truth of God unto them.
So will the gray hairs of your dear parents, yet alive, go down to the grave with joy,
to see you the posterity of Truth, as well as theirs,
and that not only their nature but spirit shall live in you when they are gone.

I shall conclude this account with a few words to those that are not of our communion,
into whose hands this may come, especially those of our own nation.

Friends, as you are the sons and daughters of Adam, and my brethren after the flesh,
often and earnest have been my desires and prayers to God on your behalf,
that you may come to know your Creator to be your
Redeemer and Restorer to the holy image,
which through sin you have lost, by the power and spirit of his Son Jesus Christ,
whom he hath given for the light and life of the world.
And O that you, who are called Christians, would receive him into your hearts!
For there it is you want him,
and at that door he stands knocking that you might let him in:
but you do not open to him; you are full of other guests,
so that a manger is his lot among you now, as well as of old.
Yet you are full of profession, as were the Jews when he came among them,
who knew him not, but rejected and evilly entreated him.
So that if you come not to the possession and experience of what you profess,
all your formality in religion will stand you in no stead in the day of God`'s judgment.

I beseech you ponder with yourselves your eternal condition, and see what title,
what ground and foundation you have for your Christianity;
whether it be more than a profession and an historical belief of the Gospel?
Have you known the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost,
and the fan of Christ that winnows away the chaff in your minds,
the carnal lusts and affections?
That Divine leaven of the kingdom, which, being received, leavens the whole lump of man,
sanctifying him throughout in body, soul and spirit?
If this be not the ground of your confidence, you are in a miserable estate.

You will say perhaps, That though you are sinners,
and live in the daily commission of sin, and are not sanctified, as I have been speaking,
yet you have faith in Christ, who has borne the curse for you,
and in him you are complete by faith, his righteousness being imputed to you.

But, my friends,
let me entreat you not to deceive yourselves in so
important a point as is that of your immortal souls.
If you have true faith in Christ, your faith will make you clean; it will sanctify you:
for the saints`' faith was their victory of old.
By this they overcame sin within and sinful men without.
And if thou art in Christ, thou walkest not after the flesh, but after the Spirit,
whose fruits are manifest.
Yea, thou art a new creature; new made, new fashioned, after God`'s will and mould.
Old things are done away, and behold, all things are become new: new love, desires, will,
affections and practices.
It is not any longer thou that livest, thou disobedient, carnal, worldly one,
but it is Christ that liveth in thee; and to live is Christ,
and to die is thy eternal gain:
because thou art assured that thy corruptible shall put on incorruption, and thy mortal,
immortality, and that thou hast a glorious house, eternal in the heavens,
that will never wax old or pass away.
All this follows being in Christ, as heal follows fire, and light the sun.

Therefore have a care how you presume to rely upon such a notion,
as that you are in Christ, whilst in your old fallen nature.
For what communion hath light with darkness, or Christ with Belial?
Hear what the beloved disciple tells you,
"`If we say we have fellowship with God and walk in darkness, we lie,
and do not the truth.`"
That is, if we go on in a sinful way, are captivated by our carnal affections,
and are not converted to God, we walk in darkness, and cannot possibly, in that state,
have any fellowship with God.
Christ clothes those with his righteousness, who receive his grace in their hearts,
and deny themselves, and take up his cross daily and follow him.
Christ`'s righteousness makes men inwardly holy; of holy minds, wills and practices.
It is nevertheless Christ`'s though we have it; it is ours, not by nature,
but by faith and adoption: it is the gift of God.
But still, though not ours, as of or from ourselves, (for in that sense it is Christ`'s,
for it is of and from him;) yet it is ours, and must be ours, in possession,
efficacy and enjoyment, to do us any good;
or Christ`'s righteousness will profit us nothing.
It was after this manner that he was made, to the primitive Christians, righteousness,
sanctification, justification and redemption; and if ever you will have the comfort,
kernel and marrow of the Christian religion, thus you must come to learn and obtain it.

Now, my friends, by what you have read,
you may perceive that God has visited a poor people
among you with his saving knowledge and testimony;
whom he has upheld and increased to this day,
notwithstanding the fierce opposition they have met withal.
Despise not the meanness of this appearance: it was,
and yet is (we know) a day of small things, and of small account with too many;
and many hard and ill names are given to it: but it is of God,
it came from him because it leads to him.
This we know, but we cannot make another to know it,
unless he will take the same way to know it that we took.
The world talks of God, but what do they do?
They pray for power, but reject the holy Spirit in which it is.
If you would know God, and worship and serve God as you should do,
you must come to the means he has ordained and given for that purpose.
Some seek it in books, some in learned men, but what they look for is in themselves,
though not of themselves, but they overlook it.
The voice is too still, the seed too small, and the light shineth in darkness;
they are abroad, and so cannot divide the spoil: but the woman who lost her silver,
found it at home, after she had lighted her candle and swept her house.
Do you so too, and you shall find what Pilate wanted to know, viz., Truth.
Truth in the inward parts, so valuable in the sight of God.

The light of Christ within, who is the Light of the world, (and so a light to you,
that tells you the truth of your condition) leads all that take heed unto it,
out of darkness into God`'s marvellous light.
For light grows upon the obedient: it is sown for the righteous,
and their way is a shining light, that shines forth more and more to the perfect day.

Wherefore, O friends, turn in, turn in, I beseech you: where the poison is,
there is the antidote.
There you want Christ, and there you must find him; and blessed be God,
there you may find him.
Seek and you shall find, I testify for God.
But then you must seek aright, with your whole heart, as men that seek for their lives,
yea, for their eternal lives; diligently, humbly, patiently,
as those that can taste no pleasure, comfort or satisfaction in any thing else,
unless you find him whom your souls want to know and love above all.
O it is a travail, a spiritual travail! let the carnal, profane world,
think and say as it will.
And through this path you must walk to the city of God, that has eternal foundations,
if ever you will come there.

Well! and what does this blessed light do for you?
Why, first, It sets all your sins in order before you.
It detects the spirit of this world in all its baits and allurements,
and shows how man came to fall from God, and the fallen estate he is in.
Secondly, It begets a sense and sorrow, in such as believe in it, for this fearful lapse.
You will then see him distinctly whom you have pierced,
and all the blows and wounds you have given him by your disobedience,
and how you have made him to serve with your sins, and you will weep and mourn for it,
and your sorrow will be a godly sorrow.
Thirdly, After this it will bring you to the holy watch,
to take care that you do so no more, and that the enemy surprise you not again.
Then thoughts, as well as words and works, will come to judgment,
which is the way of holiness, in which the redeemed of the Lord do walk.
Here you will come to love God above all, and your neighbours as yourselves.
Nothing hurts, nothing harms, nothing makes afraid on this holy mountain.
Now you come to be Christ`'s indeed; for you are his in nature and spirit,
and not your own.
And when you are thus Christ`'s, then Christ is yours, and not before.
And here you will know communion with the Father and with the Son,
and the efficacy of the blood of cleansing, even the blood of Jesus Christ,
that immaculate Lamb, which speaks better things than the blood of Abel;
and which cleanseth from all sin the consciences of those who, through the living faith,
come to be sprinkled with it, from dead works, to serve the living God.

To conclude, behold the testimony and doctrine of the people called Quakers!
Behold their practice and discipline!
And behold the blessed man and men (at least many of them)
who were sent of God in this excellent work and service!
All which is more particularly expressed in the annals of that man of God, +++[+++George.
Fox`'s Journal,]
which I do heartily recommend to my reader`'s most serious perusal;
and beseech Almighty God, that his blessing may go along with both,
to the convincement of many, as yet strangers to this holy dispensation,
and also to the edification of God`'s church in general.
Who, for his manifold and repeated mercies and blessings
to his people in this day of his great love,
is worthy ever to have the glory, honour, thanksgiving and renown;
and be it rendered and ascribed, with fear and reverence,
through him in whom he is well pleased, his beloved Son and Lamb, our light and life,
who sits with him upon the throne, world without end.
Amen, says one whom God has long since mercifully favoured with his fatherly visitation,
and who was not disobedient to the heavenly vision and call;
to whom the way of Truth is more lovely and precious than ever, and who,
knowing the beauty and benefit of it above all worldly treasures,
has chosen it for his chiefest joy; and therefore recommends it to thy love and choice,
because he is with great sincerity and affection,

He also wrote in the same year, a _Visitation to the Jews,_
by way of appendix to a book published by John Tomkins,
called _The Harmony of the Old and New Testament._

After expressing his desire for the redemption of the Jews,
as being the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
he proceeds to show that every argument which can
be advanced in defence of the old Testament,
in which the Jews assuredly believe, is applicable to the New.
He states the unquestionable fact, that while the existence of the Apostolic writings,
at the time to which they are referred,
is proved by a succession of authors through the first ages after the Christian era,
there are none of the Jewish writers who contradict the statement of the evangelists.

From the histories of two at least of the evangelists being published,
during the lives of those who had an opportunity
of witnessing the circumstances which they relate;
and many of those facts occurring in the presence of multitudes,
he argues that these narratives would have been contradicted,
and their falsehood exposed, if they had not been true.
Even Tryphon the Jew and Celsus the Gentile, who, about the end of the second century,
cavilled at the Christian religion,
do not attempt to disprove the miracles which the evangelists record.
The fulfilment of the prophecies, contained in the New Testament,
respecting the destruction of Jerusalem and the manifold sufferings of the people,
is also adduced as evidence of the Divine authority of the Christian religion,
and the character of the Messiah,
in whom the Christians believe is shown to correspond
with the prophetic descriptions of him.

From these and other considerations the Jews are
admonished to embrace the Christian religion;
and to receive the Son and sent of the Father.
He thus concludes the tract: viz.

[.embedded-content-document]
--

And hear and bear this word, I beseech you, from me.
You can never see, know or hear the happiness of the coming of the Messiah,
till you come to a prepared frame of mind.
You must repent of your sins, turn from them and watch against all temptations,
not to commit them again;
and in this condition of mind and spirit you will
know a fitting to receive and own the Messiah,
and enjoy the blessed benefits that accrue by him to all those who embrace him.
He did come sufferingly and will come triumphantly, but those only can receive him,
and have the comfort and advantage of his first and second coming,
that come to know and receive him in his light and spirit in their hearts.

--

In the ninth, tenth and eleventh months he travelled in the work of the ministry,
in the counties of Gloucester, Somerset, Devon and Dorset,
having meetings almost daily in the principal towns, and other places in those counties.
To these meetings great numbers resorted,
and many among them assented to the truth of his doctrines.
At one of these meetings, the number of people was so great,
that they left the market house in which it began, and resorted to the open fields.
A number of meetings were held in the town halls,
which the Mayors from the respect they bore him, permitted to be opened for that purpose.

From this journey he returned to London, but of his employment there I find no account.
He appears however to have been fully occupied,
if we may judge from the tenor of a letter written from that city to John Gratton,
a fellow-labourer in the work of the Gospel: an extract from which is here given.

[.embedded-content-document.letter]
--

[.salutation]
Dear John Gratton,

Thy dear and tender love I feel by thy kind lines,
and they were to my comfort and refreshment.
Thy name has been down in my pocket-book ever since I came to this city,
to write to thee as one of my dear and choice friends, who lies and lives near me,
with whom is my dear, near, and inward fellowship; and that thou art low and poor,
and as self-independent as ever, is a brave condition,
and thou canst not say better for thyself or the greatest worthy in the flock.
O dear John, I desire to dwell there, while I live in this tabernacle.
It is my prayer, and much of my ministry to God`'s people.
Some are convinced, but not converted; and many, who are converted, do not persevere:
wherefore their oil dries up; and self, in Truth`'s form,
gets up under specious pretences.

Through the Lord`'s great mercy and beyond my hopes
I am yet tolerably well through hard service,
which it has been my lot to be engaged in of late;
in which the Lord has abundantly answered me,
and tender-hearted friends and sober people of all sorts.

As yet I have not seen my own home above these four months.
I am a poor pilgrim on the earth,
yet my hope is established for an abiding place in an unchangeable world.

Dear John, never trouble thyself with priests.
Let them have our books.
Take two or three gross things from theirs, confute them, and leave the rest.
Methinks J. R. (Sir John Rhodes, who was Gratton`'s neighbour,
and had become a Quaker) should exercise himself that way,
which would whet him up to services suitable to his condition.
My love to him and the Doctor, (Gilbert Heathcote,
who had married Sir John Rhodes`'s sister:) I remember them in my prayers to the Lord,
that they may travel on to the end, and receive the crown of faithfulness.
So, in the Lord`'s love, dearly farewell

[.signed-section-closing]
Thy cordial friend and loving brother,

In the year 1695, a writer who chose to conceal his name,
published what he called an answer to William Penn`'s _Key;_
a tract which has been noticed under the transactions of 1692.
This drew from him a reply containing further illustrations
of the subjects embraced in the _Key._ There is near the beginning of this reply,
a passage in relation to his conduct during the preceding reign,
which evincing a consciousness of the integrity of his motives, may be here inserted.

The anonymous writer, having charged him with prevarication,
and attributed his conduct to an intemperate zeal for an unbounded liberty of conscience,
according to the doctrine of King James`'s declaration;
he refers him to several of his works which were published in Charles`'s time,
to show that he always defended the same principles,
and was not more intemperate in the reign that favoured liberty of conscience,
than he was in the one which did not.
To which he adds, "`No man but a persecutor, can without great injustice or ingratitude,
reproach that part I had in King James`'s court.
For I think I may say, without vanity, upon this provocation,
I endeavoured at least to do some good at my own cost,
and would have been glad to have done more.
I am very sure I intended and I think I did harm to none,
either parties or private persons, my own family excepted.`"
And the injury done to his own family he shrewdly supposes
could be no great offence in the view of his opponent.

In the autumn of this year,
William Penn paid a religious visit to some of the western counties of England.
In the eighth month he was present at a dispute held at Melksham in Wiltshire,
between John Plympton a Baptist and John Clark a Friend.
The said Baptist had challenged the people called Quakers to a conference, on five heads,
viz. 1. The universality of grace; 2. Baptism; 3. The Supper; 4. Perfection;
5+++.+++ The Resurrection.
The objections of the Baptist were ably met and answered by John Clark,
to the general satisfaction of the numerous auditors.
But Plympton, though confuted, was not silenced.
At length evening coming on,
William Penn arose and bore a powerful and convincing
testimony to the doctrines of the Society,
which obtained the marked attention of the audience.
After which he concluded the meeting with prayer.

In the following month he visited Wells,
where two of his friends procured a grant of the market house to hold a meeting in;
but the clerk of the market was afterwards induced
to retract his promise and refuse them admission.
They then concluded to hold their meeting at a public house;
of which they gave notice to the bishop, as required by the act of toleration.
The room in which they assembled, had adjoining it a balcony which opened to the street.
The room being soon filled and a large concourse collected in the street,
William Penn took his station in the balcony,
and from that place addressed this double auditory.
But in the midst of his declaration, he was interrupted by officers,
with a warrant from the Mayor;
which from its tenor appears to have been drawn up while he was preaching to the people.
The officers were too officious to permit him to finish his testimony,
though requested so to do, but instantly hurried him before the Mayor and his associate,
who upon examination, soon discovered that they had themselves been violating the law,
by disturbing a lawful assembly held in a house regularly certified.
They therefore excused themselves as well as they could, and set him at liberty.
Yet they afterwards threatened the innkeeper with a fine,
for permitting a conventicle to be held in his house.
The bishop`'s certificate however, being procured,
to show that due notice of the meeting was given, no further proceedings were attempted.

This circumstance sufficiently proves,
that the spirit of persecution was still alive in some parts of Great Britain,
notwithstanding the act of toleration.
It is however fair to add,
that this instance appears to have originated with
the civil officers and not with the clergy.^
footnote:[The bishop to whom notice of this meeting was given,
and who treated Friends respectfully, was Robert Redder,
who was afterwards advantageously known as the author
of a work entitled "`A Demonstration of the Messias.`"]

Friends after this hired a house in that city for a meeting place,
at which William Penn subsequently had a meeting to good satisfaction.
Several other meetings,
and the Quarterly Meeting for the county were afterwards held there.

From Wells William Penn proceeded to visit other places in the county,
holding meetings almost daily as he went along.
He at length visited Bristol, where he stayed some time,
and thence returned to his home at Worminghurst in Essex.

Although friends were relieved by the act of toleration,
from fines and imprisonment on account of their meetings for worship,
they were still subject to great inconvenience and frequent losses,
because of their conscientious refusal to take the oaths,
which on numerous occasions were required by law.
Efforts were therefore made in 1693, and renewed in subsequent years,
to obtain an act of parliament allowing them to give testimony upon their solemn affirmation,
instead of an oath; with the condition annexed,
that in case any of them should be duly convicted of making, in that manner,
a false declaration,
they should be liable to the same penally as though
they had been convicted of corrupt perjury.
In 1695, the subject gained so much place with persons in power,
that a bill was brought into the house for granting the relief desired.
Whether William Penn took part in these applications, is uncertain,
but while the bill was depending,
he presented a brief memorial to the house of commons on the subject,
of which the following is a copy.

[.embedded-content-document.address]
--

[.letter-heading]
To the Honourable House of Commons.

[.blurb]
=== A few words crave their perusal, upon occasion of the Bill to excuse the people called Quakers from swearing.

That the request of the people called Quakers,
may be indulged by the members of this honourable house,
it is humbly proposed to them to consider the nature
and fulness of the security they offer;
and if it be found to amount to the weight and value of an oath,
it is hoped there will be no difficulty in accepting it in lieu of an oath.

The pledge that every man upon oath gives of his truth is his soul;
he means that God should deal with him according to the truth of
his affirmative or negative given by him in the name of God.
Now that the said people do as much, viz: That they pledge their souls too, in their way;
that they mean the same caution with them that swear,
and are under the same reverence in their simple and solemn aye or no,
and therefore give the same security;
I shall beg this honourable house to consider three things:

[.numbered-group]
====

[.numbered]
_First,_ that this people make it an article of their faith and practice,
and a great part of their characteristic, not to swear at all.
They think, whether mistaken or no,
that the righteousness of Christianity does not need nor use an oath;
so that you have their religion, in the highest exercises of it, in human affairs,
for your security.

[.numbered]
_Secondly,_ that they have often, and at very dear rates, proved to the world,
they mean what they say; since they have frequently chosen to lose their estates,
and lie and die in jail, rather than save the one, or deliver the other,
by deviating from their principle; and since in such cases,
integrity is the security all aim at,
it is hard to conceive which way any man can give a greater; nor are they so insensible,
as not to know that untruth in them, after this great indulgence,
is a more aggravated crime than perjury in others;
since they excuse themselves from not swearing,
by a profession of an exacter simplicity and greater strictness.

[.numbered]
_Lastly,_ they humbly hope, that being to suffer for untruth as for perjury,
their request will not be uneasy; since they subject their integrity to trial,
upon the hazard of a correction, that is so much greater than the nature of the offence,
in the eye of the law, would bear.
Let them then, pray, speak in their own way; and if false, be punished in yours.
And since this honourable house has testified an excelling zeal
to secure the rights and privileges of that great body they represent,
this inferior member, with all due respect, claiming a relation to it,
request they may not be left exposed in theirs; but that by your wisdom and goodness,
they may be provided for, in true proportion to the exigencies they are under;
which will engage them in the best wishes for your prosperities.

The issue of the case was the passage of a law,
to come into force on the 4th of third month 1696,
permitting every Quaker in England or Wales,
to make a solemn declaration of a prescribed form,
in all cases where an oath was previously required;
and rendering such affirmation equivalent in law to an oath;
except that they were not permitted to give evidence in criminal cases,
to serve on juries, or to hold any office of profit in the government.
In procuring this act,
Friends received the aid of the influence and talents of the king and Waller the poet,
who was then a member of the house of Commons.

It is a remarkable circumstance that this act,
permitting the members of a Society long known to be conscientiously scrupulous of swearing,
to substitute a solemn declaration in place of an oath,
was procured with considerable difficulty, and granted with apparent hesitation;
for it was to continue in force for seven years,
and to the end of the next session of parliament and no longer.
The form of the affirmation in this first act was not satisfactory,
the terms being considered as too nearly approximating to those of an oath,
and many Friends declined its use on that account,
choosing to suffer all the inconvenience and hardship
to which they had been hitherto subjected,
rather than obtain relief in so questionable a manner.
The act was at length made perpetual,
though the terms of the affirmation being still uneasy to many Friends,
it failed to afford the intended relief.
At length, in 1721, an act was obtained,
giving to the affirmation a form with which Friends were generally satisfied.

From the enactment being made at first for seven years, and then for eleven,
before it was declared perpetual, it would appear that dispensing with an oath,
even in favour of those who were restrained from its use by religious principle,
was then viewed as a legislative experiment of doubtful expediency;^
footnote:[It even appears that some of those who favoured this act,
granted the affirmation under the belief that it
was in reality an oath of a disguised form.
Writers are not, indeed, altogether agreed what constitutes an oath.
If we regard the legal definition, we must perceive that this affirmation was not an oath.
It was in these words, _I, A. B., do declare in the presence of Almighty God,
the witness of the truth of what I say._
But according to legal authorities, "`what is universally understood by an oath, is,
that the person who takes it, imprecates the vengeance of God upon him,
if the oath he takes is false.`"]
yet in 1830 and J.835, the use of oaths, in a great number of cases,
was abolished by act of parliament, after a very full examination of their effect,
and a satisfactory conviction that the truth might be as well obtained by a simple declaration.

On the 5th of first month, 1696, William Penn accomplished his marriage at Bristol,
with Hannah Callowhill, daughter of Thomas Callowhill,
and grand-daughter of Dennis Hollister, both eminent merchants of that city.
She was a sober, religious young woman,
and continued an agreeable companion to him during the remainder of his life.

Shortly after this event, he was subjected to a heavy trial,
by the death of his eldest son, a youth of a very promising character,
both in regard to his understanding, which was of the brightest order,
and the more substantial virtues of the heart.
The account which he has given of this son is too interesting to be omitted;
it is as follows:

[.embedded-content-document.testimony]
--

My very dear child and eldest son, Springett Penn,
from his childhood manifested a disposition to goodness,
and gave me hope of a more than ordinary capacity;
and time satisfied me in both respects.
Besides a good share of learning and especially of mathematical knowledge,
he showed a judgment in the use and application of it, much above his years.
He had the seeds of many good qualities rising in him, which made him beloved,
and consequently lamented; but especially his humility, plainness and truth;
with a tenderness and softness of nature, that if I may say it,
were an improvement upon his other good qualities.
And though these were no security against sickness and death,
yet they went a good way to facilitate a due preparation for them.
Indeed the good ground that was in him showed itself
very plainly sometime before his illness.
For more than half a year before it pleased the Lord to visit him with weakness,
he grew more retired, and much disengaged from youthful delights;
showing a remarkable tenderness in meetings, even when they were silent.
But when he saw himself doubtful as to his recovery,
he turned his mind and meditations more apparently towards the Lord; secretly,
as also when those were in the room who attended upon him,
praying often with great fervency to the Lord,
and uttering many thankful expressions and praises
to Him in a very deep and sensible manner.
One day he said to us, I am resigned to what God pleaseth; he knows what is best.
I would live if it pleased him that I might serve him.
But, O Lord, not my will, but thy will be done.

One speaking to him of the things of this world,
and what might please him when recovered; he answered, My eye looks another way,
where the truest pleasure is.
When he told me he had rested well, and I said it was a mercy to him,
he quickly replied upon me, with a serious yet sweet look, All is mercy, dear father,
everything is mercy.
Another time when I went to meeting, at parting, he said, Remember me, my dear father,
before the Lord.
Though I cannot go to meetings, yet I have many good meetings;
the Lord comes in upon my spirit; I have heavenly meetings with him by myself.

Not many days before he died, while alone,
the Lord appeared by his holy power upon his spirit, and at my return,
asking him how he did, he told me, O I have had a sweet time, a blessed time!
Great enjoyments.
The power of the Lord overcame my soul: a sweet time indeed!

On my telling him how some of the gentry who had been to visit him,
were gone to their games, and sports and pleasures,
and how little consideration the children of men had of God and their latter end;
and how much happier he was in this weakness, to have been otherwise educated,
and to be preserved from those temptations to vanity, etc, he answered, It is all stuff,
my dear father: it is sad stuff.
O that I might live to tell them so!
Well my dear child, I replied,
let this be the time of thy entering into secret covenant with God,
that if he raise thee, thou wilt dedicate thy youth,
strength and life to him and his people and service.
He returned, Father, that is not now to do; it is not now to do;
with great tenderness upon his spirit.

Being almost ever near him, and doing any thing for him he wanted or desired,
he broke out with much sense and love, My dear father, if I live I will make thee amends.
And speaking to him of Divine enjoyments, that the eye of man saw not, but the soul,
made alive by the spirit of Christ, plainly felt; he, in a lively remembrance, cried out,
I had a sweet time yesterday by myself!
O the Lord hath preserved me to this day!
O blessed be his name; my soul praises him for his mercy!
Father, it is of the goodness of the Lord that I am as well as I am!
Fixing his eyes upon his sister, he took her by the hand, saying, Poor Tishe,
look to good things, poor child, there is no comfort without it.
One drop of the love of God is worth more than all the world.
I know it; I have tasted it:
I have felt as much or more of the love of God in
this weakness than in all my life before.
At another time as I stood by him he looked up upon me and said, Dear father, sit by me,
I love thy company, and I know thou lovest mine;
and if it be the Lord`'s will that we must part, be not troubled,
for that will trouble me.

Taking something one night in bed, just before going to rest, he sat up,
and fervently prayed thus: O Lord God, thou whose Son said to his disciples,
Whatsoever ye ask in my name, ye shall receive; I pray thee in His name,
bless this to me this night, and give me rest, if it be thy blessed will, O Lord!
And accordingly he had a very comfortable night,
of which he took a thankful notice before us next day.

And when he at one time, more than ordinarily, expressed a desire to live,
and entreated me to pray for him; he added, dear father,
if the Lord should raise me and enable me to serve him and his people,
then I might travel with thee sometimes,
and we might ease one another (meaning in the ministry:) he spoke it with great modesty.
Upon which I said to him, my dear child, if it please the Lord to raise thee,
I am satisfied it will be so; and if not,
then inasmuch as it is thy fervent desire in the Lord,
he will look upon thee just as if thou didst live to serve him,
and thy comfort will be the same: so either way it will be well.
For if thou shouldst not live,
I do verily believe thou wilt have the recompense of thy good desires,
without the temptations and troubles that would attend,
if long life were granted to thee.

Saying one day I am resolved I will have such a thing done;
he immediately catched himself, and fell into this reflection, with much contrition,
Did I say, I will?
O Lord, forgive me that irreverent and hasty expression!
I am a poor weak creature and live by thee, and therefore I should have said,
if it pleaseth thee that I live, I intend to do so, or so;
Lord forgive my rash expression.

Seeing my present wife ready to be helpful and do any thing for him,
he turned to her and said, Don`'t thou do so, let them;
don`'t trouble thyself so much for such a poor creature as I am.
On her taking leave of him a few nights before his end, he said to her, Pray for me,
dear mother: thou art good and innocent, it may be the Lord may hear thy prayers for me,
for I desire my strength again, that I might live,
and employ it more in the Lord`'s service.

Two or three days before his departure, he called his brother to him,
and looking awfully upon him said, Be a good boy, and know there is a God,
a great and mighty God, who is a rewarder of the righteous, and so he is of the wicked,
but their rewards are not the same.
Have a care of idle people and idle company, and love good company and good Friends,
and the Lord will bless thee: I have seen good things for thee since my sickness,
if thou dost but fear the Lord.
And if I should not live, though the Lord is all-sufficient, remember what I say to thee,
when I am dead and gone: poor child, the Lord bless thee, come and kiss me!
Which melted us all into great tenderness, but his brother more particularly.

Many good exhortations he gave to some of the servants, and others who came to see him,
that were not of our communion, as well as those that were,
which drew tears from their eyes.

The day but one before he died, he went to take the air in a coach;
but said at his return, Really, father, I am exceedingly weak,
thou canst not think how weak I am.
My dear child, I replied, thou art weak, but God is strong,
who is the strength of thy life: Ay, that is it, said he, which upholdeth me.
The day before he departed, being alone with him, he desired me to fasten the door;
and looking earnestly upon me, said, Dear father, thou art a dear father,
and I know thy Father, come let us two have a little meeting,
a private ejaculation together, now no body else is here.
O my soul is sensible of the love of God!
And indeed a sweet time we had, like to precious ointment for his burial.

He desired to go home, if not to live, to die there, and we made preparation for it,
being twenty miles from my house; and so much stronger was his spirit than his body,
that he spoke of going next day, which was the morning he departed;
and a symptom it was of his great journey to his longer home.
That morning he left us, growing more and more sensible of his extreme weakness,
he asked me, as doubtful of himself, How shall I go home?
I told him in a coach; he answered, I am best in a coach.
But observing his decay, I said, Why child?
thou art at home everywhere; Ay, said he, So I am in the Lord.
I took that opportunity to ask him if I should remember his love to his friends at Bristol,
London, etc.
Yes, yes, said he, my love in the Lord; my love to all Friends in the Lord:
And relations too?
he said, Ay, to be sure.
Being asked if he would have his ass`'s milk, or eat any thing; he answered,
No more outward food, but heavenly food is provided for me.

His time drawing on apace, he said to me, My dear father, kiss me,
thou art a dear father, I desire to prize it: how can I make thee amends?

He also called his sister, and said to her, Poor child, come and kiss me:
there seemed a tender and long farewell between them.
I sent for his brother that he might kiss him too, which he did:
all were in tears about him, and turning his head to me, he said softly, Dear father,
hast thou no hope for me?
I answered, My dear child, I am afraid to hope, and I dare not despair; but am,
and have been resigned, though one of the hardest lessons I ever learned.
He paused awhile, and with a composed frame of mind, said, Come life, come death,
I am resigned: O the love of God overcomes my soul!
Feeling himself decline apace,
and seeing him not able to bring up the matter that was in his throat,
somebody fetched the doctor, but so soon as he came in, he said,
Let my father speak to the doctor, and I will go to sleep; which he did,
and waked no more; breathing his last on my breast, the 10th day of the second month,
between the hours of nine and ten in the morning, 1696, in his one and twentieth year.

So ended the life of my dear child and eldest son, much of my comfort and hope,
and one of the most tender and dutiful, as well as ingenuous and virtuous youths, I knew,
if I may say so of my own dear child.
In him I lost all that any father can lose in a child,
since he was capable of any thing that became a sober young man; my friend and companion,
as well as most affectionate and dutiful child.

May this loss and end have its due weight and impression
upon all his dear relations and friends,
and those to whose hands this account may come,
for their remembrance and preparation for their great and last change;
and I shall have my end in making my dear child thus far public.

William Penn

--

The year in which the events last mentioned occurred,
appears to have been passed by William Penn chiefly at home;
yet he was not entirely occupied with his secular concerns, for he published a tract,
entitled "`Primitive Christianity Revived,
in the faith and practice of the people called Quakers.`"

This was intended to include, in a compendious form,
a general illustration and defence of the doctrines
of Friends--it is divided into eleven sections;
and is as follows:

[.asterism]
'''

[.old-style]
=== Primitive Christianity Revived, in the Faith and Practice of the People Called Quakers; / written in testimony to the present dispensation of God through them, to the world; that prejudices may be removed, the simple informed, the well-inclined encouraged, and the Truth and its innocent friends rightly represented.

[.blurb]
=== Epistle to the Reader.

By this short treatise, thou wilt perceive the subject of it, viz:
The light of Christ in man, as the manifestation of God`'s love for man`'s happiness.
Forasmuch as this is a peculiar testimony and characteristic of the people called Quakers,
and their great fundamental in religion;
that by which they have been distinguished from other
professors of Christianity in their time,
and to which they refer all people about faith, worship, and practice,
both in their ministry and writings; that as the fingers shoot out of the hand,
and the branches from the body of the tree; so true religion,
in all the parts and articles of it, springs from the Holy Spirit in man;
and because the prejudices of some are very great against this people and their way;
and others, who love their seriousness, and commend their good life, are yet,
through mistakes, or want of inquiry,
under jealousy of their unsoundness in some points of faith;
and that there are not a few in all persuasions,
who desire earnestly to know and enjoy God in that
sensible manner which this people speak of,
and who seem to long after a state of holiness and acceptance with God;
but are under doubts and despondings of attaining it,
from the want they find in themselves of inward power to enable them,
and are unacquainted with this efficacious agent,
which God hath given and appointed for their supply;

For these reasons and motives, I have taken in hand to write this small tract,
of the nature and virtue of the light of Christ within man; what and where it is,
and for what end, and therein of the religion of the people called Quakers;
that at the same time, all people may be informed of their true character,
and what true religion is, and the way to it,
in this age of high pretences and as deep irreligion.
That so the merciful visitation of the God of light and love,
more especially to these nations, both immediately and instrumentally,
for the promotion of piety, which is religion indeed,
may no longer be neglected by the inhabitants thereof,
but that they may come to see and say, with heart and mouth,
This is a dispensation of love and life from God to the world; and this poor people,
whom we have so much despised, and so often trodden upon,
and treated as the off-scouring of the earth, are the people of God,
and children of the Most High.
Bear with me, reader, I know what I say, and am not high-minded, but fear:
I write with humility towards God, though with confidence towards thee.
Not that thou shouldst believe upon my authority, nothing less;
for that is not to act upon knowledge, but trust;
but that thou shouldst try and approve what I write: for that is all I ask,
as well as all I need for thy conviction, and my own justification.

And when thou, reader, shalt come to be acquainted with the Holy Spirit,
and the plain and happy teachings of it, thou wilt, with us,
admire that thou shouldst have lived so long a stranger to what was so near thee,
and as much wonder that others should be so blind as not to see it,
as formerly thou thoughtest us singular for obeying it.
The day I believe is at hand, that will declare this with an uncontrolable authority,
because it will be with an unquestionable evidence.

I have done, reader, with this preface, when I have told thee, First,
that I have stated the principle, and opened as God has enabled me,
the nature and virtue of it in religion;
wherein the common doctrines and articles of the Christian religion are delivered;
about which, I have endeavoured to express myself in plain and proper terms,
and not in figurative, allegorical, or doubtful phrases;
that so I may leave no room for an equivocal or double sense;
but that the truth of the subject I treat upon,
may appear easily and evidently to every common understanding.
Next I have confirmed what I have written by Scripture, reason,
and the effects of it upon so great a people;
whose uniform concurrence in the experience and practice thereof,
through all times and sufferings, since we were a people,
challenge the notice and regard of every serious reader.
Thirdly, I have written briefly, that so it might be every one`'s reading.
Much in a little is best, when we see daily that the richer people grow,
the less money or time they have for God or religion.
And perhaps those who would not buy a large book,
may find in their hearts to give away some of these for their neighbour`'s good.
Be serious, reader, be impartial, and then be as inquisitive as thou canst;
and that for thine own soul,
as well as the credit of this most misunderstood and abused people.
And the God and Father of lights and spirits, so bless thine,
in the perusal of this short treatise, that thou mayest receive real benefit by it,
to his glory and thine own comfort, which is the desire and end of him that wrote it;
who is in the bonds of Christian charity, very much and very ardently,

[.signed-section-closing]
Thy real friend,

[.signed-section-signature]
William Penn.

[.old-style]
=== Section I. / 1. Their fundamental principle. 2+++.+++ The nature of it. 3+++.+++ Called by several names. 4+++.+++ They refer all to this, as to faith and practice, ministry and worship.

[.numbered-group]
====

[.numbered]
1+++.+++ That which the people called Quakers lay down, as a main fundamental in religion,
is this, That God, through Christ, hath placed his Spirit in every man,
to inform him of his duty, and to enable him to do it;
and that those who live up to this, are the people of God,
and those that live in disobedience to it, are not God`'s people,
whatever name they may bear or profession they may make of religion.
This is their ancient, first and standing testimony.
With this they began, and this they bore, and do bear to the world.

[.numbered]
2+++.+++ By this spirit they understand something that is Divine; and though in man,
yet not of man, but of God; and that it came from him,
and leads to him all those that will be led by it.

[.numbered]
3+++.+++ There are divers ways of speaking, which they have been led to use,
by which they declare and express what this Spirit is,
about which I think fit to precaution the reader, viz., They call it,
The light of Christ within man, or, light within, which is their ancient,
and most general and familiar phrase; also the manifestation or appearance of Christ,
the witness of God, the seed of God, the seed of the kingdom, wisdom,
the word in the heart, the grace that appears to all men,
the Spirit given to every man to profit with, the Truth in the inward parts,
the spiritual leaven, that leavens the whole lump of man:
many of which are figurative expressions,
but all of them such as the Holy Ghost hath used,
and which will be used in this treatise,
as they are most frequently in the writings and ministry of this people.
But that this variety and manner of expression may not occasion
any misapprehension or confusion in the understanding of the reader,
I would have him know, that they always mean by these terms or denominations,
not another, but the same as before mentioned: which, as I said, though it be in man,
is not of man, but of God, and therefore divine: and one in itself,
though diversely expressed by the holy men,
according to the various manifestations and operations thereof.

[.numbered]
4+++.+++ It is to this spirit of light, life, and grace, that this people refer all:
for they say it is the great agent in religion; that, without which,
there is no conviction, so no conversion or regeneration;
and consequently no entering into the kingdom of God.
That is to say, there can be no true sight of sin or sorrow for it,
and therefore no forsaking or overcoming it, nor remission or justification from it.
A necessary and powerful Spirit indeed,
when neither sanctification nor justification can be had without it.
In short, there is no becoming virtuous, holy and good, without this;
no acceptance with God, nor peace of soul, but through it.
But on the contrary, that the reason of so much irreligion among Christians,
so much superstition instead of devotion, and so much profession without enjoyment,
and so little heart-reformation, is, because people in religion overlook the Holy Spirit,
and leave it behind them.
They will be religious without it, and Christians without it,
though this be the only means of making them so indeed.
So natural is it to man in his degenerate state, to prefer sacrifice before obedience,
and to make prayers go for practice, and so flatter himself with hope,
by ceremonial and bodily service,
to excuse himself to God from the stricter discipline of his Spirit in the soul,
which leads man to take up the cross, deny self, and do that which God requires of him.
This is every man`'s true religion, and every such man is truly religious: that is,
he is holy, humble, patient, meek, merciful, just, kind, and charitable; which they say,
no man can make himself; but that the Holy Spirit will make all men so,
who will embrace the convictions and teachings of it,
being the root of all true religion in man,
and the good Seed from whence all good fruits proceed.

====

To sum up what they say upon the nature and virtue of it,
as contents of that which follows, they declare that this Spirit is, first, Divine.
Secondly, universal.
Thirdly, efficacious: In that it gives man,

[.numbered-group]
====

[.numbered]
_First,_ the knowledge of God and of himself,
and therein a sight of his duty and disobedience to it.

[.numbered]
_Secondly,_
it begets a true sense and sorrow for sin in those
that seriously regard the convictions of it.

[.numbered]
_Thirdly,_ it enables them to forsake sin, and sanctifies from it.

[.numbered]
_Fourthly,_ it applies God`'s mercies in Christ for the forgiveness of sins that are past,
unto justification, upon sincere repentance and obedience.

[.numbered]
_Fifthly,_ it gives to the faithful, perseverance unto a perfect man,
and the assurance of blessedness world without end.

====

To the truth of all which, they call in a threefold evidence: First, the Scriptures,
which give an ample witness, especially those of the New and better Testament.
Secondly, the reasonableness of it in itself.
And lastly, a general experience, in great measure: but particularly, their own,
made credible by the good fruits they have brought forth,
and the answer God has given to their ministry: which, to impartial observers,
have commended the doctrine, and gives me occasion to abstract their history,
in divers particulars, for a conclusion to this little treatise.

[.old-style]
=== Section II. / 1+++.+++ The evidence of Scripture for the light of Christ, John 1:4. 9. 2+++.+++ His Divinity. 3+++.+++ All things created by him. 4+++.+++ What he is to man, as to salvation.

[.numbered-group]
====

[.numbered]
1+++.+++ I shall begin with the evidence of the blessed Scriptures of Truth,
for this Divine light, the first and most common word used by them,
to express and denominate it by,
as well as most apt and proper in this dark state of the world.

[.syllogism]
* John 1:1. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
* Verse 8. All things were made by him.
* Verse 4. In him was life, and the life was the light of men.
* Verse 9. That was the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.

[.numbered]
2+++.+++ I have begun with him,
who began his history with him that was the beginning of the creation of God;
the most beloved disciple, and longest liver of all the apostles,
and he who for excellent knowledge and wisdom in heavenly things,
is justly entitled John the Divine.
He tells us first, what Christ was in the beginning, viz: the Word.
"`In the beginning was the Word.`"

And though that shows what the Word must be, yet he adds and explains,
that "`the Word was with God,
and the Word was God;`" lest any should doubt of the Divinity of the Word,
or have lower thoughts of him than he deserved.
The Word then, is Divine, and an apt term it is, that the evangelist styles him by,
since it is so great an expression of the wisdom and power of God to men.

[.numbered]
3+++.+++ "`All things were made by him.`"
If so, he wants no power.
And if we were made by him, we must be new made by him too, or we can never enjoy God.
His power shows his dignity,
and that nothing can be too hard for such a sufficiency as made all things,
and without which nothing was made, that was made.
As man`'s Maker must be his husband, so his Creator must be his Redeemer also.

[.numbered]
4+++.+++ "`In him was life, and the life was the light of men.`"
This is our point.
The evangelist first begins with the nature and being of the Word:
from thence he descends to the works of the Word: and lastly, he tells us,
what the Word is, with respect to man above the rest of the creation, viz:
The Word was life, and the life was the light of men.
The relation must be very near and intimate, when the very life of the Word,
that was with God, and was God, is the light of men: as if men were next to the Word,
and above all the rest of his works; for it is not said so of any other creature.

====

Man cannot be without light then; no not a Divine light: for if this be not Divine,
which is the life of the Divine Word,
there can be no such thing at all as Divine or supernatural light and life.
And the text does not only prove the Divinity of the light,
but the universality of it also, because man mentioned in it, is mankind:
which is yet more distinctly expressed in his ninth verse, "`That was the true light,
which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.`"
Implying, that he that lighteth not mankind is not that true light;
and therefore John was not that light, but bore witness of him who was,
and who lighteth every man; to wit, the Word that took flesh:
so that both the Divine nature, and universality of the light of Christ within,
are confirmed together.

[.old-style]
=== Section III. / 1. How this Scripture is wrested. 2+++.+++ That it is a natural light; 3. That it lighteth not all; 4+++.+++ That it is only the doctrine and life of Christ when in the flesh; all answered, and its Divinity and universality proved.

[.numbered-group]
====

[.numbered]
1+++.+++ But though there be no passage or proposition to be found in Holy Scripture,
in which mankind is more interested, or that is more clearly laid down by the Holy Ghost,
than this I have produced,
yet hardly hath any place been more industriously wrested from its true and plain sense:
especially since this people have laid any stress upon it,
in defence of their testimony of the light within.

Some will have it to be but a natural light, or a part of man`'s nature,
though it be the very life of the Word by whom the world was made,
and mentioned in those verses which only concern his eternal power and Godhead.
But because I would be understood, and treat of things with all plainness,
I will open the terms of the objection as well as I can, and then give my answer to it.

[.numbered]
2+++.+++ If by natural be meant a created thing, as man is,
or any thing that is requisite to the composition of man, I deny it:
the text is expressly against it, and says, the light with which man is lighted,
is the life of the Word which was with God, and was God.
But if by natural is only intended, that we have it as sure as we are born,
or have nature; and that it is the light of our minds and understandings,
and is not the result of any revelation from without, as by angels or men;
then we mean and intend the same thing.
It is thus natural to man to have a supernatural light,
and for the creature to be lighted by an uncreated light,
as is the life of the creating Word.
And did people but consider the constitution of man,
it would conduce much to preserve or deliver them from any dilemma upon this account.
For man can no more be a light to his mind, than he is to his body.
He has the capacity of seeing objects when he has the help of light,
but cannot be a light to himself, by which to see them.
Wherefore as the sun in the firmament, is the light of the body,
and gives us discerning in`' our temporal affairs;
so the life of the Word is the glorious light and sun of the soul;
our intellectual luminary, that informs our mind,
and gives us true judgment and distinction about those things
that more immediately concern our better and inward man.

[.numbered]
3+++.+++ But others will have this text read thus, not that the Word enlightens all mankind,
but that all who are enlightened, are enlightened by him,
thereby not only narrowing and abusing the text, but rendering God partial,
and so severe to his creatures, as to leave part of the world in darkness,
without the means or opportunity of salvation; though we are assured from the Scriptures,
that all have light, that Christ is the light of the world, and that he died for all;
yea, the ungodly, and that God desires not the death of any,
but rather that all should repent and come to the knowledge of the Truth and be saved;
and that the grace of God has appeared to all men, etc.

[.numbered]
4+++.+++ There is a third sort who will needs have it understood,
not of any illumination by a Divine light or spirit in man,
but by the doctrine Christ preached, and the life and example he lived,
and led in the world; which neither reached the thousandth part of mankind,
nor can consist with what the apostle John intends in the beginning of his history,
which wholly relates to what Christ was before he took flesh, or at least,
what he is to the soul, by his immediate inshinings and influences.
It is most true, Christ was, in a sense, the light of the world, in that very appearance,
and shined forth by his heavenly doctrine, many admirable miracles,
and his self-denying life and death.
Yet that hinders not, but that he was and is the spiritual light,
which shineth more or less, in the hearts of the sons and daughters of men.
For as he was a light in his life and conversation,
he was only a light in a more excellent sense than he spoke of to his disciples,
when he said, Ye are the light of the world.
But Christ the Word enlightened them, and enlightens us,
and enlightens all men that come into the world; which he could not be said to do,
if we only regard his personal and outward appearance.
In that sense it is long since he was that light, but in this he is continually so.
In that respect he is remote, but in this sense he is present and immediate,
else we should render the text, That was the true light which did lighten,
instead of which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.
And that the evangelist might be so understood, as we speak,
he refers to this as an evidence of his being the Messiah, and not John,
for whom many people had much reverence; for in verse eighth, he saith of John,
He was not that light, but was sent to bear witness of that light.
Now comes his proof and our testimony,
That was the true Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world;
which was not John, or any else, but the Word that was with God, and was God.
The evangelist did not describe him by his fasting forty days, preaching so many sermons,
working so many miracles, and living so holy a life; and,
after all so patiently suffering death, which yet Christ did;
thereby to prove him the light of the world; but, says the evangelist,
That was the true light, the Word in flesh, the Messiah, and not John, or any else,
which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.
So that Christ is manifested and distinguished by giving light:
and indeed so are all his followers from other people, by receiving and obeying it.
There are many other Scriptures, of both Testaments, that refer to the light within;
either expressly, or impliedly; which for brevity`'s sake, I shall waive reciting.

====

[.old-style]
=== Section IV. / 1. The virtue of the light within; it gives discerning. 2+++.+++ It manifests God. 3+++.+++ It gives life to the soul. 4+++.+++ It is the apostolical message. 5+++.+++ Objection answered about two lights. 6+++.+++ About natural and spiritual light: not two darknesses within, therefore not two lights within. 7+++.+++ The apostle John answers the objection fully: the light the same, I. John 2:8-9.

[.numbered-group]
====

[.numbered]
1+++.+++ The third thing,
is the virtue and efficacy of this light for the end for which God hath given it,
viz. To lead and guide the soul of man to blessedness.
In order to this the first thing it does in and for man,
is to give him a true sight or discerning of himself, what he is, and what he does;
that he may see and know his own condition, and what judgment to make of himself,
with respect to religion and a future state.
Of which, let us hear what the Word himself saith, who cannot err, as John relates it,
chap.
iii. 20, 21. For every one that doth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light,
lest his deeds should be reproved.
But he that doth Truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest,
that they are wrought in God.
A most pregnant instance of the virtue and authority of the light.
First, It is that by which men ought to examine themselves.
Secondly, It gives a true discerning betwixt good and bad, what is of God,
from what is not of God.
And lastly it is a judge, and condemneth or acquitteth, reproveth or comforteth,
the soul of man, as he rejects or obeys it.
That must needs be Divine and efficacious, which is able to discover to man,
what is of God, from what is not of God;
and which gives him a distinct knowledge in himself, of what is wrought in God,
from what is not wrought in God.
By which it appears,
that this place does not only regard the discovery of man and his works, but,
in some measure, it manifesteth God and his works also, which is yet something higher;
for as much as it gives the obedient man a discovery
of what is wrought or performed by God`'s power,
and after his will, from what is the mere workings of the creature himself.
If it could not manifest God, it could not tell man what was God`'s mind,
nor give him such a grounded sense and discerning of the rise, nature,
and tendency of the workings of his mind or inward man,
as is both expressed and abundantly implied in this passage of our Saviour.
And if it reveals God, to be sure it manifests Christ, who flows and comes from God.
Who then would oppose or slight this blessed light?

[.numbered]
2+++.+++ But that this light doth manifest God,
is yet evident from Rom. 1:19. Because that which
may be known of God is manifest in men,
for God hath showed it unto them.
An universal proposition; and we have the apostle`'s word for it,
who was one of a thousand, and inspired on purpose to tell us the truth;
let it then have its due weight with us.
If that which may be known of God is manifest in men, the people called Quakers cannot,
certainly, be out of the way in preaching up the light within, without which,
nothing can be manifested to the mind of man;
as saith the same apostle to the Ephesians, Eph. 5:13.
Whatsoever doth make manifest is light.
Well then may they call this light a manifestation or appearance of God,
that showeth in and to man, all that may be known of God.
A passage much like this, is that of the prophet Micah, chap.
vi. 8. He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee,
but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?
God hath showed thee, O man!
It is very emphatical.
But how hath he showed him?
Why by this light in the conscience, which the wicked rebel against, Job 24:13.
Who for that cause, know not the ways, nor abide in the paths thereof:
for its ways are ways of pleasantness, and all its paths are peace, to them that obey it.

[.numbered]
3+++.+++ But the light giveth the light of life, which is eternal life,
to them that receive and obey it.
Thus, says the blessed Saviour of the world, "`I am the light of the world,
he that followeth me shall not abide in darkness, but shall have the light of life.`"
Now he is the light of the world,
because he lighteth every man that cometh into the world,
and they that obey the light obey him, and therefore have the light of life.
That is, the light becomes eternal life to the soul: that as it is the life of the Word,
which is the light in man, so it becomes the life in man, through his obedience to it,
as his heavenly light.

[.numbered]
4+++.+++ Furthermore, this light was the very ground of the apostolical message,
as the beloved disciple assures us: "`This then is the message,
which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light,
and in him is no darkness at all: If we say we have fellowship with him,
and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth: But if we walk in the light,
as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another,
and the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanseth us from all sin.`"
Which is so comprehensive of the virtue and excellency of the light, in reference to man,
that there is little need more should be said upon it; forasmuch as, first,
it reveals God, and God himself is light.
Secondly, it discovers darkness from light, and that there is no fellowship between them.
Thirdly, that man ought to walk in the light.
Fourthly, that it is the way to obtain forgiveness of sin, and sanctification from it.
Fifthly, that it is the means to have peace and fellowship with God and his people,
his true church, redeemed from the pollutions of the world.

[.numbered]
5+++.+++ Some perhaps, may object, as indeed it hath been more than once Objected upon us,
that this is another light, not that light wherewith every man is enlightened.
But the same apostle, in his evangelical history, tells us, that in the Word was life,
and the life was the light of men, and that that very light,
that was the life of the Word,
was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.
Where is there so plain a text to be found against the sufficiency,
as well as universality of the light within;
or a plainer for any article of faith in the whole book of God?
Had the beloved disciple intended two lights in his evangelical history,
and in his epistles, to be sure he would have noted to us his distinction:
but we read of none, and by the properties ascribed in each writing,
we have reason to conclude he meant the same.

[.numbered]
6+++.+++ But if any shall yet object, That this is to be understood of a spiritual light,
and that ours is to be a natural one, I shall desire them to do two things: first,
to prove that a natural light, as they phrase it, doth manifest God,
other than as I have before explained and allowed; since whatever is part of man,
in his constitution, but especially in his degeneracy from God,
is so far from yielding him the knowledge of God, that it cannot rightly reprove,
or discover that which offends him, without the light we speak of: and it is granted,
that what we call Divine, and some mistakenly call natural, light, can do both.
Secondly, if this light be natural,
notwithstanding it doth manifest our duty and reprove our disobedience to God,
they would do well to assign us some certain medium, or way,
whereby we may truly discern and distinguish between the
manifestations and reproofs of the natural light within,
from those of the Divine light within, since they allow the manifestation of God,
and reproof of evil, as well to the one, as to the other.
Let them give us but one Scripture that distinguishes
between a natural and a spiritual light within.
They may with as much reason talk of a natural and spiritual darkness within.
It is true, there is a natural proper darkness, to wit, the night of the outward world;
and there is a spiritual darkness, viz: the clouded and benighted understandings of men,
through disobedience to the light and Spirit of God: but let them assign us a third,
if they can.
People use, indeed, to say, improperly, of blind men, they are dark,
and we may call a natural or idiot so, if we will:
but where is there another darkness of the understanding, in the things of God?
If they can, I say, find that, in and about the things of God, they do something.

Christ distinguished not between darkness and darkness, or light and light,
in any such sense; nor did any of his disciples:
yet both have frequently spoken of darkness and light.
What difference, pray, doth the Scripture put between spiritual darkness,
and darkness mentioned in these places,
Luke 1:7,9. Matt. 4:16. John 1:5., and 3:19, and 8:12, 31, 46.
1 Thess. 5:4. 1 John 1:6. Acts 26:18. Rom. 13:12. 2 Cor. 6:14,22. Eph. 5:8. Col. 1:13.
Upon the strictest comparison of them I find none.
It is all one spiritual darkness.
Neither is there so much as one Scripture that affords
us a distinction between light within and light within;
or that there are really two lights from God, in man, that regard religion.
Peruse Matt. 4:16. Luke 2:32, and 15:8. John 1:4,5,7,8,9, and 3:19, 20, 21, and 8:12.
Acts 26:18. Rom. 13:12. 2 Cor. 4:6, and 6:14. Eph. 5:13-8. Col. 1:12. 1 Thess. 5:5.
1 Tim. 6:16. 1 Pet. 2:9. 1 John 1:5,7, and 2:8. Rev. 21:23-24, and 22:5.
We believe the greatest opposer to our assertion,
will not be able to sever light from light, or find out two lights within,
in the passages here mentioned, or any other,
to direct man in his duty to God and his neighbour: and if he cannot,
pray let him forbear his mean thoughts and words of the light of Christ within man,
as man`'s guide in his duty to God and man.
For as he must yield to us, that the light manifesteth evil, and reproveth for it;
so doth Christ himself teach us of the light,
"`For every one that doth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light,
lest his deeds should be reproved.`"
And the apostle Paul plainly saith,
"`But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light;`"
therefore there are not two distinct lights within,
but one and the same manifesting, reproving, and teaching light within.
And this the apostle John, in his first epistle, makes plain, beyond all exception,
to all considerate people: First, in that he calls God, light, chap. 1. 5.
Secondly, in that he puts no medium, or third thing between that light, and darkness, verse 6.
"`If we say we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness,
we lie,`" etc.; intimating, that men must walk either in light or darkness,
and not in a third, or other state or region.
I am sure, that which manifests and reproves darkness, cannot be darkness.
This all men must confess.

[.numbered]
7+++.+++ And as if the apostle John would have anticipated their objection, viz: "`It is true,
your light within reproves for evil,
but it is not therefore the Divine light which leads into higher things,
and which comes by the Gospel;`" he thus expresseth himself, "`The darkness is past,
and the true light now shineth.
He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother,
is in darkness even until now;`" which is not another light than that mentioned before, chap. 1.
For as light is put there, in opposition to darkness, so light here,
is put in opposition to darkness.
"`And as the darkness is the same, so must the light be the same.
Wherefore we may plainly see, that it is not another light,
than that which reproves a man for haling his brother,
which brings a man into fellowship with God, and to the blood of cleansing,
as the next verse speaks:
therefore that light which reproveth a man for hating his brother,
is of a Divine and efficacious nature.
In short, that light which is opposite to,
and reproves spiritual darkness in man and woman, is a spiritual light;
but such a light is that which we confess, testify to, and maintain;
therefore it is a spiritual light.
It is also worth our notice, that the apostle useth the same manner of expression here,
chap. 2. 8.
The true light shineth, that he doth in his evangelical history, chap. 1. 9.
That was the true light; intimating that the same Divine Word,
or true light now shineth; and that it is the same true light in his account,
which reproveth such as hate their brethren: consequently,
that light which so reproveth them, is the true light.
Christ and his disciples, but especially his beloved one, often make that very light,
which stoops to the lowest step of immorality, and to the reproof of the grossest evil,
to be no other than the same Divine light, in a further degree of manifestation,
which brings such as follow it to the light of life, to the blood of cleansing,
and to have fellowship with God, and one with another: nay, not only so,
but the apostle makes a man`'s being a child of God,
to depend upon his answering this light in a palpable and common case, viz:
not hating of his brother;
and strange it is that any should shut their eyes
so fast against beholding the virtue of it,
as to conclude it a natural and insufficient light,
which is both unscriptural and unreasonable.
Shall we slight it, because we come so easily by it,
and it is so familiar and domestic to us?
Or make its being so common, an argument to undervalue so inestimable a mercy?
What is more common than light, and air, and water?
And should we therefore contemn them, or prize them?
Prize them, certainly; as what we cannot live, or live comfortably, without.
The more general the mercy is, the greater,
and therefore the greater obligation upon man to live humbly and thankfully for it.
And to those alone that do so, are its Divine secrets revealed.

[.numbered]
1+++.+++ _Objection:_ But some may say, We could willingly allow to the Spirit and grace of God,
which seemed to be the peculiar blessing of the new and second covenant,
and the fruit of the coming of Christ, all that which you ascribe to the light within;
but except it appeared to us that this light were
the same in nature with the Spirit and grace of God,
we cannot easily bring ourselves to believe what you say in favour of the light within.

[.discourse-part]
_Answer:_ This objection, at first look, seems to carry weight with it:
but upon a just and serious review, it will appear to have more words than matter,
show than substance: yet because it gives occasion to solve scruples,
that may be thrown in the way of the simple, I shall attend it throughout.
I say, then, if it appear that the properties ascribed to the light within,
are the same with those that are given to the Holy Spirit and grace of God;
and that those several terms or epithets,
are only to express the divers manifestations or operations of one and the same Spirit,
then it will not, it cannot be denied, but this light within, is Divine and efficacious,
as we have asserted it.
Now, that it is of the same nature with the Spirit and grace of God,
and tends to the same end, which is to bring people to God,
let the properties of the light be compared with those of the Spirit and grace of God.
I say they are the same, in that, First, the light proceeds from the one Word,
and one life of that one Word, which was with God and was God, John 1:4,
and i. 9. Secondly, it is universal, it lighteth every man.
Thirdly, it giveth the knowledge of God, and fellowship with him, Rom. 1:19.
John 3:21. 1 John 1:5-6. Fourthly, it manifesteth and reproveth evil, John 3:20.
Eph. 5:13. Fifthly, it is made the rule and guide of Christian walking, Ps. 43:3.
John 8:12. Eph. 5:13,15. Sixthly,
it is the path for God`'s people to go in,
Ps. 119:105. Prov. 4:18. Isaiah 2:5. 1 John 1:7. Rev. 21:24,
And the nations of them that are saved, shall walk in the light of the Lamb.
Lastly, it is the armour of the children of God against Satan, Ps. 27:1,
The Lord is my light, whom shall I fear?
Rom. 13:12, Let us put on the armour of light.

[.numbered]
2+++.+++ Now let all this be compared with the properties of the Holy Spirit,
and their agreement will be very manifest.
First, it proceeded from God, because it is the Spirit of God, Rom. 6:11. Secondly,
it is universal.
It strove with the old world, Gen. 6:3. Then to be sure with the new one:
Every one hath a measure of it given to profit withal, 1 Cor. 12:7. Thirdly,
it revealeth God, Job 32:8. 1 Cor. 2:10-11. Fourthly, it reproveth sin, John 16:8.
Fifthly, it is a rule and guide for the children of God to walk by, Rom. 8:14.
Sixthly, it is also the path they are to walk in, Rom. 8:1.
Gal. 5:15, Walk in the Spirit.
Lastly, this is not all; it is likewise the spiritual weapon of a true Christian,
Eph. 6:17, Take the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.
After this,
I hope none will deny that this light and this Spirit must be of one and the same nature,
that work one and the same effect, and tend evidently to one and the same holy end.

[.numbered]
3+++.+++ And what is said of the light and Spirit, may also,
very well be said of the light and grace of God; in that, First,
the grace floweth from Christ, the Word, that took flesh, as well as the light;
for as in him was life, and that life the light of men,
so he was full of grace and truth, and of his fulness have all we received,
and grace for grace, John 1:4. 9. 14. 16. Secondly, it is universal;
both from this text, and what the apostle to Titus teacheth;
For the grace of God that bringeth salvation, hath appeared to all men, Tit. 2:11-12.
Thirdly, it manifesteth evil,
for if it teaches to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, it must needs detect them,
and so says the text.
Fourthly, it revealeth godliness, and consequently it must manifest God.
Fifthly, it is an instructor and guide; for, says the apostle,
It teaches to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously,
and godly in this present world, and herein is a rule of life, Tit. 2:11-12. Sixthly,
it is to all that receive it, all that they can need or desire, 2 Cor. 12:9,
My grace is sufficient for thee.
A high testimony from heaven, to the power of this teaching and saving grace,
under the strongest temptations.

[.numbered]
4+++.+++ _Objection._
But there is little mention made of the Spirit, and none of the grace,
before Christ`'s coming, and therefore the Spirit,
as spoken of in the writings of the New Testament, and especially the grace,
must be another, and a nobler thing than the light within.

[.discourse-part]
_Answer._
By no means another thing, but another name,
for another manifestation or operation of the same Spirit.
It is called light from the distinction and discerning it gives.
Let there be light, and there was light, said God in the beginning of the old world;
so there is first light in the beginning of the new creation of God in man.
It is called Spirit, because it giveth life, sense, motion, and vigor:
and it is as often mentioned in the writings of the Old as New Testament;
which every reader may see, if he will but please to look into his Scripture concordance.
Thus God`'s Spirit strove with the old world, Gen. 6:3.
and with Israel in the wilderness, Neh. 9:30. And David asked,
in the agony of his soul, Whither shall I go from thy Spirit?
Ps. 139:7; and the prophets often felt it.
It is styled grace, not from its being another Spirit,
but because it was a fuller dispensation of the virtue
and power of the same Divine Spirit;
and that being purely God`'s favour and mercy, and not man`'s merit, is aptly,
and deservedly called the grace, favour, or good-will of God, to undeserving man.
The wind does not always blow fresh, nor heaven send down its rain freely,
nor the sun shine forth clearly; shall we therefore say,
it is not of the same kind of wind, rain or light, when it blows, rains,
or shines but a little, as when it blows, rains, or shines much?
It is certainly the same in nature and kind; and so is this blessed Spirit,
under all its several dispensations, manifestations and operations,
for the benefit of man`'s soul, ever since the world began.

[.numbered]
5+++.+++ But this is most freely, humbly and thankfully acknowledged by us,
that the dispensation of the Gospel was the clearest, fullest, and noblest of all other;
both with regard to the coming of Christ in the flesh,
and being our one holy offering to God for sin, through the eternal Spirit;
and the breaking forth of his light, the effusion of his Spirit,
and appearance of his grace in, and to man, in a more excellent manner,
after his ascension.
For though it was not another light, or Spirit,
than that which he had given to man in former ages,
yet it was another and greater measure;
and that is the privilege of the Gospel above former dispensations.
What before shined but dimly, shines since with great glory.
Then it appeared but darkly, but now with open face.
Types, figures and shadows veiled its appearances and made them look low and faint;
but in the Gospel time, the veil is rent, and the hidden glory manifest.
It was under the law but as a dew or small rain, but under the Gospel,
it may be said to be poured out upon men;
according to that gracious and notable promise of God, by the prophet Joel,
"`In the latter days I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh.`"
Thus we say when it rains plentifully, look how it pours.
So God augments his light, grace and Spirit to these latter days.
They shall not have it sparingly, and by small drops, but fully and freely,
and overflowing too.
And thus Peter, that deep and excellent apostle, applies that promise in Joel,
on the day of Pentecost, as the beginning of the accomplishment of it.
This is grace, and favour, and goodness indeed.
And therefore well may this brighter illumination, and greater effusion of the Spirit,
be called grace; for as the coming of the Son excelled that of the servant,
so did the manifestation of the light and Spirit of God, since the coming of Christ,
excel that of the foregoing dispensations; yet ever sufficient to salvation,
to all those that walked in it.
This is our sense of the light, Spirit, and grace of God: and by what is said,
it is evident they are one and the same, and that he that has light,
need not want the Spirit or grace of God, if he will but receive it, in the love of it:
for the very Spirit, that is light to show him, is also Spirit to quicken him,
and grace to teach, help, and comfort him.
It is sufficient in all circumstances of of life,
to them that diligently mind and obey it.

1+++.+++ _Objection._
But some may yet say, If it be as you declare, how comes it,
that all who are enlightened, are not so good as they should be;
or as you say this would make them?

[.discourse-part]
_Answer._
Because people do not receive and obey it: all men have reason,
but all men are not reasonable.
Is it the fault of the grain, in the granary, that it yields no increase,
or of the talent in the napkin, that it is not improved?
It is plain a talent was given; and as plain that it was improvable;
both because the like talents were actually improved by others,
and that the just Judge expected his talent with advantage; which else, to be sure,
he would never have done.
Now when our objectors will tell us, whose fault it was that the talent was not improved,
we shall be ready to tell them,
why the unprofitable servant was not so good as he should have been.
The blind must not blame the sun, nor sinners tax the grace, of insufficiency.
It is sin that darkens the eye, and hardens the heart,
and that hinders good things from the sons of men.
If we do his will, we shall know of his Divine doctrine, so Christ tells us.
Men not living up to what they know, cannot blame God, that they know no more.
The unfruitfulness is in us, not in the talent.
It were well indeed, that this were laid to heart.
But alas! men are too apt to follow their sensual appetites,
rather than their reasonable mind, which renders them brutal instead of rational.
For the reasonable part in man, is his spiritual part,
and that guided by the Divine logos, or Word,
which Tertullian interprets reason in the most excellent sense,
makes man truly reasonable;
and then it is that man comes to offer up himself to God a reasonable sacrifice.
Then a man indeed; a complete man; such a man as God made,
when he made man in his own image, and gave him paradise for his habitation.

[.numbered]
2+++.+++ _Objection._
But some yet object, If mankind had always the Holy Spirit,
how comes it that Gospel truths were not so fully known before the coming of Christ,
to those that were obedient to it.

[.discourse-part]
_Answer._
Because a child is not a grown man, nor the beginning the end;
and yet he that is the beginning, is also the end: the Spirit is the same,
though not the manifestation.
As the world has many steps and periods of time towards its end,
so hath man to his perfection.
They that are faithful to what they know of the dispensation of their own day,
shall hear the happy welcome, of "`Well done, good and faithful servant.`"
And yet many of God`'s people in those days,
had a prospect of the glory of the latter times, the improvement of religion,
and the happiness of the church of God.

This we see in the prophecy of Jacob and Moses,
concerning the restoration of Israel by Christ.
So David, in many of his excellent psalms,
expressing most sensible and extraordinary enjoyments, as well as prophecies;
particularly his 2nd, 15th, 18th, 22nd, 23rd, 25th, 27th, 32nd, 36th, 37th, 42nd, 43rd,
45th, 51st, 84th, etc.
The prophets are full of it, and for that reason have their name; particularly Isaiah,
chapters 2nd, 9th, 11th, 25th, 28th, 32nd, 35th, 42nd, 49th, 50th, 51st, 52nd, 53rd,
54th, 59th, 60th, 61st, 63rd, 65th, 66th. Jeremiah also, chapters 23rd, 30th, 31st,
33rd. Ezekiel, chapters 20th, 34th, 36th, 37th. Daniel, chapters 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th,
12th. Hosea, chapters 1st, 3rd. Joel, chapters 2nd, 3rd. Amos, chapter 9th. Micah,
chapters 4th, 5th. Zachariah, chapters 6th, 8th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 14th. Malachi,
chapters 3rd, 4th. This was not another Spirit, though another manifestation of the same,
nor was it common, but particular and extraordinary in the reason of it.

It was the same Spirit that came upon Moses, which came upon John the Baptist,
and it was also the same Spirit that came upon Gideon and Sampson,
that fell upon Peter and Paul; but it was not the same dispensation of that Spirit.
It hath been the way of God, to visit and appear to men,
according to their states and conditions, and as they have been prepared to receive him,
be it more outwardly or inwardly, sensibly or spiritually.
There is no capacity too low, or too high, for this Divine Spirit:
for as it made and knows all, so it reaches unto all people.
It extends to the meanest, and the highest cannot subsist without it.
Which made David break forth in his expostulations with God,
"`Whither shall I go from thy Spirit, or whither shall I flee from thy presence?`"
Implying it was everywhere, though not everywhere, or at every time, alike.
If I go to heaven, to hell, or beyond the seas, even there shall thy hand lead me,
and thy right hand shall hold me.
That is, there will this Divine Word, this light of men, this Spirit of God, find me,
lead me, help me, and comfort me.
For it is with me wherever I am, and wherever I go, in one respect or other;
"`When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee;
and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee:`" and I can no more get rid of it,
if I would, than of myself, or my own nature; so present is it with me,
and so close it sticks unto me.
"`When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers,
they shall not overflow thee; when thou walkest through the fire,
thou shalt not be burnt, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.`"
David knew it, and therefore had a great value for it.
"`In thy light shall we see light,`" or we shall be enlightened by thy light.
"`Thou wilt light my candle; the Lord my God will lighten my darkness.`"
Again, "`The Lord is my light, whom shall I fear.`"
It was his armour against all danger.
It took fear away from him, and he was undaunted, because he was safe in the way of it.
Of the same blessed Word he says elsewhere, "`It is a lamp unto my feet,
and a lanthorn to my paths.`"
In short, a light to him in his way to blessedness.

[.numbered]
3+++.+++ _Objection._
But if the Jews had this light, it does not follow that the gentiles had it also;
but by your doctrine all have it.

[.discourse-part]
_Answer._
Yes, and it is the glory of this doctrine which we profess,
that God`'s love is therein held forth to all.
And besides the texts cited in general,
which are as full and positive as can be expressed,
the apostle is very particular in the second chapter of his Epistle to the Romans,
"`That the gentiles having not the law, did by nature the things contained in the law,
and were a law unto themselves.`"
That is, they had not an outward law, circumstanced as the Jews had;
but they had the work of the law written in their hearts,
and therefore might well be a law to themselves, that had the law in themselves.
And so had the Jews too,
but then they had greater outward helps to quicken their obedience to it;
such as God afforded not unto any other nation:
and therefore the obedience of the gentiles, or uncircumcision, is said to be by nature,
or naturally, because it was without those additional, external,
and extraordinary ministries and helps which the Jews had to provoke them to duty.
Which is so far from lessening the obedient gentiles,
that it exalts them in the apostle`'s judgment;
because though they had less advantages than the Jews,
yet the work of the law written in their hearts,
was made so much the more evident by the good life they lived in the world.
He adds, their consciences bearing witness, or as it may be rendered,
witnessing with them, and their thoughts, meanwhile, accusing,
or else excusing one another,
in the day when God shall judge the secrets of all hearts by Jesus Christ,
according to my Gospel.
Which presents us with four things to our point, and worth our serious reflection.
First, that the gentiles had the law written in their hearts.
Secondly, that their conscience was an allowed witness or evidence about duty.
Thirdly,
that the judgment made thereby shall be confirmed
by the apostle`'s Gospel at the great day,
and therefore valid and irreversible.
Fourthly, that this could not be,
if the light of this conscience were not a Divine and sufficient light:
for conscience truly speaking, is no other than the sense a man hath,
or judgment he maketh, of his duty to God,
according to the understanding which God gives him of his will.
And that no ill, but a true and Scriptural use may be made of this word conscience,
I limit it to duty, and that to a virtuous and holy life, as the apostle evidently doth,
about which we cannot miss, or dispute; read verses seventh, eighth, and ninth.
It was to that therefore the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ desired to be made manifest,
for they dared to stand the judgment of conscience,
in reference to the doctrine they preached and pressed upon men.
The beloved disciple also makes it a judge of man`'s present and future state,
under the term heart; viz; for if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart,
and knoweth all things.
Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God.
Plain and strong words: and what were they about, but whether we love God,
in deed and in truth: and how must that appear?
Why, in keeping his commandments, which is living up to what we know.
And if any desire to satisfy themselves further of the divinity of the gentiles,
let them read Plato, Seneca, Plutarch, Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius Antoninus,
and the gentile writers.
They will also find many of their sayings collected in the first part of a book,
called "`The Christian Quaker,`" and compared with the testimonies of Scripture,
not for their authority, but agreeableness.
In them they may discern many excellent truths,
and taste great love and devotion to virtue;
a fruit that grows upon no tree but that of life, in any age or nation.
Some of the most eminent writers of the first ages, such as Justin Martyr, Origen,
Clemens Alexandrinus, etc, bore them great respect,
and thought it no lessening to the reputation of Christianity,
that it was defended in many gentile authors, as well as that they used and urged them,
to engage their followers to the faith, as Paul did the Athenians with their own poets.

But it may be said, If it were one Holy Spirit, why so many modes and shapes of religion,
since the world began?
For the Patriarchal, Mosaical, and Christian, have their great differences;
to say nothing of what has befallen the Christian,
since the publication of it to the world.

[.discourse-part]
_Answer._
I know not how properly they may be called divers religions,
that assert the true God for the object of worship;
the Lord Jesus Christ for the only Saviour; and the light, or Spirit of Christ,
for the great agent and means of man`'s conversion and eternal felicity,
any more than infancy, youth, and manhood, make three men,
instead of three growths or periods of time, of one and the same man.
But passing that, the many modes, or ways of God appearing to men, arise,
as hath been said, from the divers states of men,
in all which it seems to have been his main design to prevent idolatry and vice,
by directing their minds to the true object of worship, and pressing virtue and holiness.
So that though mediately he spoke to the patriarchs,
mostly by angels in the fashion of men, and by them to their families,
over and above the illumination in themselves; so to the prophets, for the most part,
by the revelation of the Holy Ghost in them, and by them to the Jews;
and since the Gospel dispensation, by his Son, both externally,
by his coming in the flesh, and internally, by his spiritual appearance in the soul,
as he is the great light of the world: yet all its Sowings mediately through others,
have still been from the same Spirit,
cooperating with the manifestation of it immediately in man`'s own particular.

[.numbered]
2+++.+++ This is of great weight, for our information and encouragement, that God`'s work,
in reference to man, is all of a piece, and in itself, lies in a narrow compass,
and that his eye has ever been upon the same thing in all his dispensations, viz.,
to make men truly good, by planting his holy awe and fear in their hearts.
Though he has condescended, for the hardness and darkness of men`'s hearts,
to approach and spell out his holy mind to them, by low and carnal ways,
as they may appear to our more enlightened understandings;
suffering Truth to put on divers sorts of garments,
the better to reach to the low state of men,
to engage them from false gods and ill lives;
seeing them sunk so much below their nobler part, and what he made them,
that like brute beasts, they knew not their own strength and excellency.

[.numbered]
3+++.+++ And if we do but well consider the reason of the prevalency of idolatry,
upon the earlier and darker times of the world,
of which the Scripture is very particular, we shall find that it ariseth from this;
that it is more sensual, and therefore calculated to please the senses of men;
being more outward or visible, or more in their own power to perform,
than one more spiritual in its object.
For as their gods were the workmanship of men`'s hands, they could not prefer them,
that being the argument which did most of all gall their worshippers,
and what of all things, for that reason, they were most willing to forget.
But their incidency to idolatry,
and the advantages it had upon the true religion with them, plainly came from this,
that it was more outward and sensual: they could see the object of their devotion,
and had it in their power to address it when they would.
It was more fashionable too,
as well as better accommodated to their dark and brutal state.
And therefore it was, that God, by many afflictions and great deliverances,
brought forth a people to endear himself to them,
that they might remember the hand that saved them, and worship him, and him only;
in order to root up idolatry, and plant the knowledge and fear of him in their minds,
for an example to other nations.
Whoever reads Deuteronomy, which is a summary of the other four books of Moses,
will find the frequent and earnest care and concern of that good man for Israel,
about this very point; and how often that people slipped and lapsed,
notwithstanding God`'s love, care and patience over them,
into the idolatrous customs of the nations about them.
Divers other Scriptures inform us also, especially those of the prophets, Isaiah liv.
and Iv. Psalms xxxvii.
and cxv.
and Jer.
x., where the Holy Ghost confutes and rebukes the people,
and mocks their idols with a sort of holy disdain.

[.numbered]
4+++.+++ Now that which is furthest from idolatry, and the best antidote against it,
is the Spirit of God we have spoken of;
and the more people`'s minds are turned and brought to it, and they resolve their faith,
worship and obedience into the holy illuminations and power of it,
the nearer they grow to the end of their creation, and consequently to their Creator.
They are more spiritually qualified, and become better fitted to worship God as he is:
who, as we are told by our Lord Jesus Christ, is a Spirit,
and will be worshipped in Spirit and in Truth,
and that they are such sort of worshippers which God seeketh to worship him,
in this Gospel day.
The hour cometh, saith he, and now is; that is, some now do so, but more shall.
A plain assertion in present,
and a promise and prophecy of the increase of such worshippers in future.
Which shows a change intended from a ceremonial worship and state of the church of God,
to a spiritual one.
Thus the text, "`But the hour cometh, and now is,
when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in Spirit and in Truth.`"
Which is as much as to say, when the worship of God shall be more inward than outward,
and so more suitable to the nature of God, and the nobler part of man, his inside,
or his inward and better man, for so those blessed words import, in Spirit and in Truth.
In Spirit, that is, through the power of the Spirit.
In Truth, that is, in realities, not in shadows, ceremonies, or formalities,
but in sincerity, with and in life, being Divinely prepared and animated;
which brings man not only to offer up right worship,
but also into intimate communion and fellowship with God, who is a Spirit.

[.numbered]
5+++.+++ And if it be duly weighed,
it will appear that God in all his manifestations of himself,
hath still come nearer and nearer to the insides of men,
that he might reach to their understandings and open their hearts,
and give them a plainer and nearer acquaintance with himself in Spirit:
and there it is that man must seek and find the knowledge of God for his eternal happiness.
Indeed, all things that are made, show forth the power and wisdom of God,
and his goodness too, to mankind;
and therefore many men urge the creation to silence atheistical objections:
but though all those things show a God, yet man does it above all the rest.
He is the precious stone of the ring, and the most glorious jewel of the globe;
to whose reasonable use, service and satisfaction,
the whole seems to be made and dedicated.
But God`'s delight, by whom man was made, we are told by the Holy Ghost,
is in the habitable parts of the earth, with the sons of men, Prov. 8:31.
And with those that are contrite in spirit, Isaiah 66:1.
And why is man his delight, but because man only, of all his works,
was of his likeness.
This is the intimate relation of man to God: somewhat nearer than ordinary;
for of all other beings, man only had the honour of being his image;
and by his resemblance to God, as I may say,
came his kindred with God and knowledge of him.
So that the nearest and best way for man to know God, and be acquainted with him,
is to seek him in himself, in his image; and as he finds that,
he comes to find and know God.
Now man may be said to be God`'s image in a double respect.
First, as he is of an immortal nature; and next,
as that nature is endued with those excellencies in a small degree,
and proportionable to a creature`'s capacity,
that are by nature infinitely and incomparably in his Creator.
For instance, wisdom, justice, mercy, holiness, patience, and the like.
As man becomes holy, just, merciful, patient, etc, by the copy he will know the original,
and by the workmanship in himself, he will be acquainted with the holy Workman.
This, reader, is the regeneration and new creature we press, Gal. 6:15-16.,
and according to this rule, we say men ought to be religious, and walk in this world.
Man, as I said just now, is a composition of both worlds; his body is of this,
his soul of the other world.
The body is as the temple of the soul, the soul the temple of the Word,
and the Word the great temple and manifestation of God.
By the body the soul looks into and beholds this world, and by the Word it beholds God,
and the world that is without end.
Much might be said of this order of things, and their respective excellencies,
but I must be brief.

[.numbered]
1+++.+++ _Objection._
Though there be many good things said, how Christ appears and works in a soul, to awaken,
convince and convert it;
yet you seem not particular enough about the death and sufferings of Christ:
and it is generally rumoured and charged upon you by your adversaries,
that you have little reverence to the doctrine of
Christ`'s satisfaction to God for our sins,
and that you do not believe, that the active and passive obedience of Christ,
when he was in the world, is the alone ground of a sinner`'s justification before God.

[.discourse-part]
_Answer._
The doctrines of satisfaction and justification, truly understood,
are placed in so strict an union, that the one is a necessary consequence of the other,
and what we say of them, is what agrees with the suffrage of Scripture,
and for the most part in the terms of it;
always believing that in points where there arises any difficulty,
be it from the obscurity of expression, mis-translation,
or the dust raised by the heats of partial writers, or nice critics,
it is ever best to keep close to the text, and maintain charily in the rest.
I shall first speak negatively, what we do not own,
which perhaps hath given occasion to those who have been more hasty than wise,
to judge us defective in our belief of the efficacy
of the death and sufferings of Christ to justification:

[.numbered]
2+++.+++ _First,_ We cannot believe that Christ is the cause, but the effect of God`'s love,
according to the testimony of the beloved disciple, John, chap,
iii--God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son into the world,
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

[.numbered]
_Secondly,_ We cannot say, God could not have taken another way to save sinners,
than by the death and sufferings of his Son, to satisfy his justice,
or that Christ`'s death and sufferings were a strict and rigid satisfaction
for that eternal death and misery due to man for sin and transgression;
for such a notion were to make God`'s mercy little concerned in man`'s salvation;
and indeed we are at too great a distance from his infinite wisdom and power,
to judge of the liberty or necessity of his actings.

[.numbered]
_Thirdly,_ We cannot say Jesus Christ was the greatest sinner in the world,
(because he bore our sins on his cross, or because he was made sin for us,
who knew no sin) an expression of great levity and unsoundness,
yet often said by great preachers and professors of religion.

[.numbered]
_Fourthly,_ We cannot believe that Christ`'s death and sufferings so satisfy God,
or justify men, as that they are thereby accepted of God.
They are indeed thereby put into a state capable of being accepted of God,
and through the obedience of faith and sanctification of the spirit,
are in a state of acceptance.
We can never think a man justified before God, while self-condemned;
or that any man can be in Christ who is not a new creature;
or that God looks upon men otherwise than they are.
We think it a state of presumption and not of salvation to call Jesus Lord,
and not by the work of the Holy Ghost; Master, and he not yet master of their affections;
Saviour, and they not saved by him from their sins; Redeemer,
and yet they not redeemed by him from their passion, pride, covetousness, wantonness,
vanity, vain honours, friendships, and glory of this world;
which is to deceive themselves; for God will not be mocked, such as men sow,
such they must reap.
And though Christ did die for us, yet we must, by the assistance of his grace,
work out our salvation with fear and trembling: as he died for sin,
so we must die to sin,
or we cannot be said to be saved by the death and sufferings of Christ,
or thoroughly justified and accepted with God.
Thus far negatively.
Now positively what we own as to justification.

[.numbered]
3+++.+++ We do believe that Jesus Christ was our holy sacrifice, atonement, and propitiation;
that he bore our iniquities,
and that by his stripes we were healed of the wounds Adam gave us in his fall;
and that God is just in forgiving true penitents upon the credit
of that holy offering which Christ made of himself to God for us;
and that what he did and suffered, satisfied and pleased God,
and was for the sake of fallen man, who had displeased God:
and that through the offering up of himself once for all, through the eternal Spirit,
he hath forever perfected those (in all times) that were sanctified,
who walked not after the flesh, but after the spirit, Rom. 8:1. Mark that.

[.numbered]
4+++.+++ In short, justification consists of two parts, or hath a two-fold consideration,
viz. justification from the guilt of sin,
and justification from the power and pollution of sin;
and in this sense justification gives a man a full and clear acceptance before God.
For want of this latter part it is, that so many souls, religiously inclined,
are often under doubts, scruples, and despondencies,
notwithstanding all that their teachers tell them of the
extent and efficacy of the first part of justification.
And it is too general an unhappiness among the professors of Christianity,
that they are apt to cloak their own active and passive
disobedience with the active and passive obedience of Christ.

The first part of justification, we do reverently and humbly acknowledge,
is only for the sake of the death and sufferings of Christ; nothing we can do,
though by the operation of the holy Spirit, being able to cancel old debts,
or wipe out old scores; it is the power and efficacy of that propitiatory offering,
upon faith and repentance, that justifies us from the sins that are past;
and it is the power of Christ`'s spirit in our hearts,
that purifies and makes us acceptable before God.
For until the heart of man is purged from sin, God will never accept of it.
He reproves, rebukes and condemns those that entertain sin there,
and therefore such cannot be said to be in a justified state;
condemnation and justification being contraries.
So that they that hold themselves in a justified
state by the active and passive obedience of Christ,
while they are not actively and passively obedient to the spirit of Christ Jesus,
are under a strong and dangerous delusion;
and for crying out against this sin-pleasing imagination, not to say doctrine,
we are staged and reproached as deniers and despisers
of the death and sufferings of our Lord Jesus Christ.
But be it known to such,
they add to Christ`'s sufferings and crucify to themselves afresh the
Son of God and trample the blood of the covenant under their feet,
who walk unholily under a profession of justification;
for God will not acquit the guilty, nor justify the disobedient and unfaithful.
Such deceive themselves, and at the great and final judgment their sentence will not be,
"`Come ye blessed,`" because it cannot be said to them,
"`Well done good and faithful,`" for they cannot be so esteemed
who live and die in a reproveable and condemnable state;
but, "`Go ye cursed, etc.`"

[.numbered]
5+++.+++ Wherefore, O my reader,
rest not thyself wholly satisfied with what Christ
has done for thee in his blessed person without thee,
but press to know his power and kingdom within thee, that the strong man,
who has too long kept thy house, may be bound and his goods spoiled,
his works destroyed and sin ended, according to 1 John 3:7. For which end,
says that beloved disciple, Christ was manifested; that all things may become new;
new heavens and new earth, in which righteousness dwells.
Thus thou wilt come to glorify God in thy body and in thy spirit, which are his;
and live to him and not to thyself.
Thy love, joy, worship and obedience; thy life, conversation and practice; thy study,
meditation and devotion, will be spiritual.
The Father and the Son will make their abode with thee,
and Christ will manifest himself to thee;
for the secrets of the Lord are with them that fear him;
and an holy unction or anointing have all those, which leads them into all truth,
and they need not the teachings of men.
They are better taught, being instructed by the Divine oracle.
They are not bare hear-say, or traditional Christians, but fresh and living witnesses;
those that have seen with their own eyes, and heard with their own ears,
and have handled with their own hands, the Word of life, in the divers operations of it,
to their souls`' salvation.
In this they meet, in this they preach, and in this they pray and praise;
behold the new covenant fulfilled, the church and worship of Christ,
the great anointed of God, and the great anointing of God,
in his holy high priesthood and offices in his church!

[.numbered-group]
====

[.numbered]
1+++.+++ And lest any should say we are equivocal in our expressions,
and allegorize away Christ`'s appearance in the flesh;
meaning only thereby our own flesh; and that as often as we mention him,
we mean only a mystery, or a mystical sense of him, be it as to his coming, birth,
miracles, sufferings, death, resurrection, ascension, mediation and judgment;
I would yet add, to preserve the well disposed from being staggered by such suggestions,
and to inform and reclaim such as are under the power and prejudice of them:

That we do, we bless God, religiously believe and confess,
to the glory of God the Father, and the honour of his dear and beloved Son,
that Jesus Christ took our nature upon him, and was like unto us in all things,
sin excepted: that he was born of the virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate,
the Roman governor, was crucified, dead,
and buried in the sepulchre of Joseph of Arimathea; rose again the third day,
and ascended into heaven, and sits on the right hand of God,
in the power and majesty of his Father; who will one day judge the world by him,
even that blessed Man, Christ Jesus, according to their works.

[.numbered]
2+++.+++ But because we so believe, must we not believe what Christ said,
"`He that is with you shall be in you.`"
"`I in them, and they in me,`" etc.
"`When it pleased God to reveal his Son in me.`"
"`The mystery hid from ages, is Christ in the gentiles, the hope of glory.`"
"`Unless Christ be in you, ye are reprobates!`"
Or must we be industriously represented as deniers of Christ`'s coining in the flesh,
and the holy ends of it, in all the parts and branches of his doing and suffering,
only because we believe and press the necessity of believing,
receiving and obeying his inward and spiritual appearance and manifestation of himself,
through his light, grace and Spirit in the hearts and consciences of men and women,
to reprove, convict, convert and change them?
This we esteem hard and unrighteous measure;
nor would our warm and sharp adversaries be so dealt with by others:
but to do as they would be done to, is too often no part of their practice,
whatever it be of their profession.

[.numbered]
3+++.+++ Yet we are very ready to declare to tho whole world, that we cannot,
think men and women can be saved by their belief of the one,
without the sense and experience of the other; and that is what we oppose,
and not his blessed manifestation in the flesh.
We say that he then overcame our common enemy, foiled him in the open field,
and in our nature triumphed over him that had overcome
and triumphed over it in our fore-father Adam,
and his posterity:
and that as truly as Christ overcame him in our natures in his own person,
so by his Divine grace, being received and obeyed by us, he overcomes him in us: that is,
he detects the enemy by his light in the conscience,
and enables the creature to resist him, and all his fiery darts; and finally,
so to fight the good fight of faith, as to overcome him, and lay hold on eternal life.

[.numbered]
4+++.+++ And this is the dispensation of grace, which we declare has appeared to all,
more or less; teaching those who will receive it,
"`to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously,
and godly in this present world;
looking for (which none else can justly do) the blessed
hope and glorious appearing of the great God,
and our Saviour Jesus Christ,`" etc.
And as from the teachings, experience and motion of this grace we minister to others,
so the very drift of our ministry is to turn people`'s minds to this grace in themselves,
that all of them may be up and doing, even the good and acceptable will of God,
and work out their salvation with fear and trembling,
and make their high and heavenly calling and election sure; which none else can do,
whatever be their profession, church or character: for such as men sow they must reap;
and his servants we are whom we obey.
Regeneration we must know, or we cannot be children of God, and heirs of eternal glory.
To be born again, another Spirit must prevail, leaven, season, and govern us,
than either the spirit of the world, or our own depraved spirits;
and this can be no other Spirit than that which dwelt in Christ;
for unless that dwell in us, we can be none of his, Rom. 8:9.
And this Spirit begins in conviction,
and ends in conversion and perseverance; and the one follows the other.
Conversion being the consequence of convictions obeyed,
and perseverance a natural fruit of conversion, and being born of God;
"`For such sin not, because the Seed of God abides in them.`"
But such, through faithfulness, continue to the end, and obtain the promise,
even everlasting life.

[.numbered]
5+++.+++ But let my reader take this along with him, that we do acknowledge that Christ,
through his holy doing and suffering, for being a Son he learned obedience,
has obtained mercy of God his Father for mankind,
and that his obedience has an influence to our salvation,
in all the parts and branches of it, since thereby he became a conqueror,
and led captivity captive, and obtained gifts for men,
with divers great and precious promises,
that thereby we might be partakers of the Divine nature,
having escaped the corruption that is in the world, through lust.
I say, we do believe and confess,
that the active and passive obedience of Christ Jesus affects our salvation throughout,
as well from the power and pollution of sin, as from the guilt,
he being a conqueror as well as a sacrifice, and both through suffering.
Yet they that reject his Divine gift, so obtained, and which he has given to them,
by which to see their sin and the sinfulness of it, and to repent and turn away from it,
and do so no more;
and to wait upon God for daily strength to resist the fiery darts of the enemy,
and to be comforted through the obedience of faith
in and to this Divine grace of the Son of God,
such do not please God, do not believe truly in God,
nor are they in a state of true Christianity and salvation.
"`Woman,`" said Christ, to the Samaritan at the well, "`hadst thou known the gift of God,
and who it is that speaketh to thee,`" etc.
People know not Christ and God,
"`whom to know is life eternal,`" because they are ignorant of the gift of God, viz:
"`A manifestation of the Spirit of God is given to every man to
profit withal;`" which reveals Christ and God to the soul.
Flesh and blood cannot do it, Oxford and Cambridge cannot do it,
tongues and philosophy cannot do it: for they who by wisdom knew not God,
had these things for their wisdom.
They were strong, deep and accurate in them; but, alas! they were clouded, puffed up,
and set further off from the inward and saving knowledge of God,
because they sought for it in them, and thought to find God there.
But the key of David is another thing, which shuts and no man opens,
and opens and no man shuts;
and this key have all they that receive the gift of God into their hearts,
and it opens to them the knowledge of God and themselves,
and gives them quite another sight,
taste and judgment of things than their educational
or traditional knowledge afforded them.
This is the beginning of the new creation of God,
and thus it is we come to be new creatures.

And we are bold to declare, there is no other way like this,
by which people can come into Christ, or be true Christians,
or receive the advantage that comes by the death and sufferings of the Lord Jesus Christ.
Wherefore we say, and upon good authority, even that of our own experience,
as well as that of the Scriptures of Truth,
Christ will prove no saving sacrifice for them who refuse to obey him for their example.
They that reject the gift, deny the Giver instead of themselves for the Giver`'s sake.
O that people were wise, that they would consider their latter end,
and the things that make for the peace thereof!
Why should they perish in a vain hope of life, while death reigns; of living with God,
who live not to him, nor walk with him?
Awake thou that sleepest in thy sin, or at best, in thy self-righteousness!
Awake, I say, and Christ shall give thee life For he is the Lord from heaven,
the quickening Spirit, who quickens us by his Spirit,
if we do not resist it and quench it by our disobedience, but receive, love and obey it,
in all the holy leadings and teachings of it. Rom. 8:14-15.
To which holy Spirit I commend my reader,
that he may "`the better see where he is,
and also come to the true belief and advantage of the doings and
sufferings of our dear and blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
who saves from the power and pollution, as well as guilt of sin,
all those who hear his knocks, and open the door of their hearts to him,
that lie may come in and work a real and thorough reformation in and for them.
Thus the benefit, virtue and efficacy of his doings and sufferings without us,
will come to be livingly and effectually applied and felt,
and fellowship with Christ in his death and sufferings known,
according to the doctrine of the apostle; which,
those who live in that which made him suffer, know not,
though they profess to be saved by his death and sufferings.
Much more might be said as to this matter, but I must be brief.

[.numbered]
6+++.+++ To conclude this chapter, we wonder not that we should be mistaken,
mis-construed and mis-represented, in what we believe and do to salvation,
since our betters have been so treated in the primitive times.
Nor indeed is it only about doctrines of religion;
for our practices in worship and discipline have had the same success.
But this is what I earnestly desire,
that however bold people are pleased to make with us,
they would not deceive themselves in the great things of their own salvation:
that while they would seem to own all to Christ,
they may not be found disowned of Christ in the last day.
Read the 7th of Matthew: it is he that hears Christ, the great Word of God,
and does what he enjoins, what he commands, and by his blessed example recommends,
who is a wise builder, who has founded his house well, and built with good materials,
and whose house will stand the last shock and judgment.
For which cause we are often plain, close and earnest with people to consider,
that Christ came not to save them in, but from, their sins;
and that they who think to discharge and release themselves of his yoke and burden,
his cross and example, and secure themselves,
and compliment Christ with his having done all for
them (while he has wrought little or nothing in them,
nor they parted with any thing for the love of him)
will finally awake in a dreadful surprise,
at the sound of the last trumpet, and at this sad and irrevocable sentence,
"`Depart from me ye workers of iniquity, I know you not.`"
May all timely avoid this terrible end, by hearkening to wisdom`'s voice,
and turning at her reproof, that she may lead them in the ways of righteousness,
and in the midst of the paths of judgment,
that their souls may come to inherit substance; even durable riches and righteousness,
in the kingdom of the Father, world without end.

[.numbered]
1+++.+++ As the Lord wrought effectually, by his Divine grace, in the hearts of this people,
so he thereby brought them to a Divine worship and ministry;
they came to experience Christ`'s words, viz. That God is a spirit,
and that he would therefore be worshipped in the Spirit, and in the Truth,
and that such worshippers the Father would seek to worship him.
For bowing to the convictions of the Spirit in themselves,
in their daily course of living,
by which they were taught to eschew that which was made manifest to them to be evil,
and to do that which was good, they, in their assembling together, sat down,
and waited for the preparation of the holy Spirit,
both to let them see their states and conditions before the Lord,
and to worship him acceptably; and as they were sensible of wants, or shortness,
or infirmities, so in the secret of their own hearts, prayer would spring to God,
through Jesus Christ, to help, assist and supply;
but they did not dare to awaken their beloved before his time;
nor approach the throne of the King of glory, till he held out his sceptre;
nor take thought what they should say,
or after their own or other men`'s studied words and forms,
for this were to offer strange fire; to pray, but not by the Spirit; to ask,
but not in the name, that is, in the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, who prayed,
as well as spoke like one having authority, that is, power,
a Divine energy and force to reach and pierce the heavens,
which he gives to all who obey his light, grace and Spirit,
in their solemn waiting upon him.
So that it is this people`'s principle, that fire must come from heaven,
life and power from God, to enable the soul to pour out itself acceptably before him.
And when a coal from his holy altar touches our lips,
then can we pray and praise him as we ought to do.
And as this is our principle, which is according to Scripture, so it is, blessed be God,
our experience and practice;
and therefore it is we are separated from the worship of men, under their several forms,
because they do not found it in the operation,
motion and assistance of the Spirit of Christ, but in the appointment,
invention and framing of man, both as to matter, words and time.
We do not dissent in our own wills, and we dare not comply against his will,
who has called us, and brought us to his own spiritual worship;
in obedience to whom we are what we are,
in our separation from the divers ways of worship in the world.

[.numbered]
2+++.+++ And as our worship stands in the operation of the Spirit of Truth in our inward parts,
as before expressed, so does our ministry.
For as the holy testimonies of the servants of God of old,
were from the operation of his blessed Spirit,
so must those of his servants be in every age,
and that which has not the Spirit of Christ for its spring, and source, is of man,
and not of Christ.
Christian ministers are to minister what they receive: this is Scripture;
now that which we receive is not our own, less another man`'s,
but the Lord`'s. So that we are not only not to steal from our neighbours,
but we are not to study or speak our own words.
If we are not to study what we are to say before magistrates for ourselves,
less are we to study what we are to say for and from God to the people.
We are to minister, as the oracles of God; if so, then must we receive from Christ,
God`'s great oracle, what we are to minister.
And if we are to minister what we receive, then not what we study,
collect and beat out of our own brains, for that is not the mind of Christ,
but our imaginations, and this will not profit the people.

[.numbered]
3+++.+++ This was recommended to the Corinthians by the apostle Paul, 1 Cor. 14.
that they should speak as they were moved, or as any thing was revealed to them,
by the Spirit, for the edification of the church; for, says he, Ye may all prophesy;
that is, ye may all preach to edification, as any thing is revealed to you,
for the good of others, and as the Spirit giveth utterance.
And as the Spirit must give Christ`'s ministers their utterance, those who are his,
are careful not to utter any thing in his name to the people, without his Spirit;
and by good consequence, they that go before the true guide,
and utter words without the knowledge of the mind of the Spirit,
are none of Christ`'s ministers.
Such, certainly run, and God has not sent them, and they cannot profit the people.
And indeed, how should they, when it is impossible that mere man, with all his parts,
arts and acquirements, can turn people from darkness to light,
and from the power of Satan to God,
which is the very end and work of the Gospel ministry.
It must be inspired men, men gifted by God, taught and influenced by his heavenly Spirit,
that can be qualified for so great, so inward, and so spiritual a work.

[.numbered]
4+++.+++ Ministers of Christ are his witnesses, and the credit of a witness is,
that he has heard, seen or handled.
And thus the beloved disciple states the truth and authority of their mission and ministry.
"`That which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes,
which we have looked upon and our hands have handled, that declare we unto you,
that your fellowship may be with us, and truly our fellowship is with the Father,
and with his Son Jesus Christ.`"
I say, if Christ`'s ministers are his witnesses, they must know what they speak; that is,
they must have experienced,
and passed through those states and conditions they preach of,
and practically know those truths they declare to the people,
or they come not in by the door, but over the wall, and are thieves and robbers.
He that has the key of David comes in at the door, Christ Jesus,
and has his admission and approbation from him, anointed by him,
the alone high Priest of the Gospel dispensation.
He it is that breathes, and lays his hands, upon his own ministers; he anoints them,
and recruits their cruse, and renews their horn with oil, that they may have it fresh,
for every occasion and service he calls them to, and engages them in.

[.numbered]
5+++.+++ Nor is this all, but as they receive freely, freely they give;
they do not teach for hire, divine for money, nor preach for gifts or rewards.
It was Christ`'s holy command to his ministers to give freely, and it is our practice.
And truly we cannot but admire that this should be made a fault,
and that preaching for hire should not be seen to be one; yea, a mark of false prophets,
when it has been so frequently and severely cried out upon,
by the true prophets of God in former times.
I would not be uncharitable, but the guilty are desired to call to mind,
who it was that offered money to be made a minister, and what it was for;
if not to get money and make a trade or livelihood by it;
and what answer he met with from the apostle Peter, Acts 8:18-20.
The Lord touch the hearts of those who are giving money to be made ministers,
in order to live by their preaching, that they may see what ground it is they build upon,
and repent, and turn to the Lord, that they may find mercy,
and become living witnesses of his power and goodness in their own souls;
so may they be enabled to tell others what God has done for them,
which is the root and ground of the true ministry;
and this ministry it is that God does bless.
I could say much on this subject, but let what has been said suffice at this time,
only I cannot but observe,
that where any religion has a strong temptation of gain to induce men to be ministers,
there is great danger of their running faster to that calling,
than becomes a true Gospel minister.

[.numbered]
1+++.+++ _Objection._
But does not this sort of ministry and worship tend to make people careless,
and to raise spiritual pride in others,
may it not give an occasion to great mischief and irreligion?

[.discourse-part]
_Answer._
By no means, for when people are of age, they, of right, expect their inheritances;
and the end of all words is to bring people to the great Word, Christ Jesus,
and then the promise of God is accomplished; "`They shall be all taught of me,
from the least to the greatest,
and in righteousness (pray mark that) they shall be established,
and great shall be their peace.`"
To this declaration of the evangelical prophet, the beloved disciple agrees,
and give a full answer to the objection: "`These things have I written unto you,
concerning them that seduce you.
But the anointing, which ye have received of him, abideth in you,
and ye need not that any man teach you, but as the same anointing teacheth you,
of all things, and is truth, and is no lie; and even as it hath taught you,
ye shall abide in him.`"
In which, three things are observable; first,
that he wrote his epistle upon an extraordinary occasion, viz. to prevent their delusion.
Secondly, That he asserts a nearer and superior minister than himself,
viz. the anointing or grace they had received;
and that not only in that particular exigency, but in all cases that might attend them.
Thirdly, that if they did but take heed to the teachings of it,
they would have no need of man`'s directions, nor fear of his seducings:
at least of no ministry that comes not from the power of the anointing;
though I rather take the apostle in the highest sense of the words:
thus also the apostle Paul to the Thessalonians; "`But as touching brotherly love,
ye need not that I write unto you;
for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.`"
But helps are useful, and a great blessing, if from God; such was John the Baptist`'s;
but remember he pointed all to Christ,
"`Lb the Lamb of God!`" "`I baptize you with water,
but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.`"
And so the true ministry does.
And while people are sensual, and under such an eclipse,
by the interposition of sin and Satan,
God is pleased to send forth his enlightened servants to awaken
and turn them from the darkness to the light in themselves,
that through obedience to it, they may come to be children of the light;
and have their fellowship one with another in it, and an inheritance at last,
with the saints in light forever.

And as it is the way God has taken to call and gather people,
so a living and holy ministry is of great advantage, to watch over,
and build up the young, and comfort and establish the feeble and simple ones.
But still I say, the more inward, the less outward;
the more people come to be taught immediately of God,
by the light of his Word and Spirit in their hearts, the less need of outward means:
read Isaiah 16:19-20. Which is held by all to be a Gospel promise,
and the sun and moon there are generally understood
to mean the external means in the church.
Compare them with John 1:13. Rom. 1:19. 1 Cor. 2:11. 15. 1 Thess.
4:9. 1 John 2:20. 27. Rev. 21:22-24. All which places prove what we assert
of the sufficiency and glorious privilege of inward and spiritual teachings.
And most certainly, as men grow in grace,
and know the anointing of the Word in themselves,
the dispensation will be less in words (though in words) and more in life;
and preaching will in great measure be turned into praising,
and the worship of God more into walking with, than talking of, God;
for that is worship indeed, which bows to his will at all times, and in all places;
the truest, the highest worship, man is capable of in this world.
And it is that conformity that gives communion, and there is no fellowship with God,
no light of his countenance to be enjoyed, no peace and assurance to be had,
further than their obedience to his will, and a faithfulness to his Word,
according to the manifestation of the light thereof in the heart.

I say, this is the truest and highest state of worship; for set days and places,
with all the solemnity of them, were most in request in the weakest dispensation.
Altars, arks and temples, sabbaths and festivals,
etc. are not to be found in the writings of the New Testament.
There, every day is alike, and every place is alike; but if there were a dedication,
let it be to the Lord.
Thus the apostle, but he plainly shows a state beyond it,
for to live (with him) was Christ, and to die was gain; for the life he lived,
was by the faith of the Son of God, and therefore it was not he that lived,
but Christ that lived in him; that is, that ruled, conducted, and bore sway in him,
which is the true Christian life, the supersensual life;
the life of conversion and regeneration;
to which all the dispensations of God and ministry of his servants have ever tended,
as the consummation of God`'s work for man`'s happiness.
Here every man is a temple, and every family a church, and every place, a meeting-place,
and every visit a meeting.
And yet a little while and it shall be so yet more and more;
and a people the Lord is now preparing to enter into this sabbath or degree of rest.

Not that we would be thought to undervalue public and solemn meetings;
we have them all over the nation where the Lord has called us.
Yea, though but two or three of us be in a corner of a country, we meet,
as the apostle exhorted the saints of his time,
and reproved such as neglected to assemble themselves.
But yet show we unto thee, O reader, a more excellent way of worship;
for many may come to those meetings, and go away carnal, dead and dry;
but the worshippers in spirit and in Truth, whose hearts bow,
whose minds adore the eternal God, who is a Spirit, in and by his Spirit,
such as conform to his will, and walk with him in a spiritual life, they are the true,
constant, living and acceptable worshippers;
whether it be in meetings or out of meetings; and as with such,
all outward assemblies are greatly comfortable,
so also do we meet for a public testimony of religion and worship,
and for the edification and encouragement of those who are yet young in the truth,
and to call and gather others to the knowledge of it, who are yet going astray;
and blessed be God, it is not in vain, since many are thereby added to the church,
that we hope and believe shall be saved.

[.numbered]
1+++.+++ As God has been pleased to call us from a human ministry,
so we cannot for conscience sake support and maintain it, and upon that score,
and not out of humour or covetousness, we refuse to pay tithes,
or suchlike pretended dues, concerning which,
many books have been written in our defence.
We cannot support what we cannot approve, but have a testimony against;
for thereby we should be found inconsistent with ourselves.

[.numbered]
2+++.+++ We dare not swear, because Christ forbids it; Matt. 5:34. 37. and James,
his true follower.
It is needless as well as evil, the reason of swearing being untruth,
that men`'s yea was not yea.
Swearing was used to awe men to truth speaking,
and to give others satisfaction that what was sworn, was true.
But the true Christian`'s yea being yea, the end of an oath is answered,
and therefore the use of it is needless, superfluous and cometh of evil.
The apostle James taught the same doctrine, and the primitive Christians practised it,
as may be seen in the Book of Martyrs; as also the earliest and best of the reformers.

[.numbered]
3+++.+++ We also believe, that war ought to cease among the followers of the Lamb Christ Jesus,
who taught his disciples to forgive and love their enemies, and not to war against them,
and kill them;
and that therefore the weapons of his true followers are not carnal but spiritual;
yea mighty, through God, to cut down sin and wickedness,
and dethrone him that is the author thereof.
And as this is the most Christian, so the most rational way;
love and persuasion having more force than weapons of war.
Nor would the worst men easily be brought to hurt those that they really think love them.
It is love and patience that must in the end have the victory.

[.numbered]
4+++.+++ We dare not give worldly honour,
or use the frequent and modish salutations of the times, seeing plainly, that vanity,
pride, and ostentation, belong to them.
Christ also forbad them in his day,
and made the love of them a mark of declension from the simplicity of purer times;
and his disciples, and their followers obeyed their Master`'s precept.
It is not to distinguish ourselves as a party, nor out of pride, ill-breeding or humour,
but in obedience to the sight and sense we have received from the Spirit of Christ,
of the evil rise and tendency thereof.

[.numbered]
5+++.+++ For the same reason we have returned to the first plainness of speech,
viz. thou and thee, to a single person, which though men give no other to God,
they will hardly endure it from us.
It has been a great test upon pride, and shown the blind and weak insides of many.
This also is out of pure conscience, whatever people may think or say of us for it.
We may be despised, and have been so often, yea, very evilly entreated,
but we are now better known, and people better informed.
In short, it is also both Scripture and grammar, and we have propriety of speech for it,
as well as peace in it.

[.numbered]
6+++.+++ We cannot allow of mixed marriages, that is,
to join with such as are not of our Society; but oppose and disown them,
if at any time any of our profession so grossly err from the rule of their communion;
yet restore them upon sincere repentance, but not disjoin them.
The book I wrote of the rise and progress of the people called Quakers,
is more full and express herein.

[.numbered]
7+++.+++ Plainness in apparel and furniture, is another testimony peculiar to us,
in the degree we have borne it to the world; as also few words, and being at a word.
Likewise temperance in food,
and abstinence from the recreations and pastimes of the world;
all which we have been taught, by the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ,
to be according to godliness; and therefore we have long exhorted all,
that their moderation may be known unto all men, for that the Lord is at hand,
to enter into judgment with us for every intemperance or excess;
and herein we hope we have been no ill examples,
nor scandal unto any that have a due consideration of things.

[.numbered]
8+++.+++ We cannot, in conscience to God, observe holy days,
(so called) the public fasts and feasts,
because of their human institution and ordination,
and that they have not a Divine warrant, but are appointed in the will of man.

[.numbered]
9+++.+++ Lastly, We have been led by the good Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ,
of which I have treated in this discourse, according to primitive practice,
to have a due care over one another, for the preservation of the whole Society,
in a conversation more suitable to their holy profession.

[.numbered]
_First,_ In respect to a strict walking both towards those that are without,
and those that are within; that their conversation in the world,
and walking in and towards the church, may be blameless.
That as they may be strict in the one, so they may be faithful in the other.

[.numbered]
_Secondly,_ That collections be made to supply the wants of the poor,
and that care be taken of widows and orphans, and such as are helpless,
as well in counsel as about substance.

[.numbered]
_Thirdly,_ That all such as intend to marry, if they have parents,
or are under the direction of guardians or trustees, are obliged,
first to declare to them their intention,
and have their consent before they propose it to one another,
and the meeting they relate to, who are also careful to examine their clearness,
and being satisfied with it,
they are by them allowed to solemnize their marriage in a public select meeting,
for that purpose appointed, and not otherwise;
whereby all clandestine and indirect marriages are prevented among us.

[.numbered]
_Fourthly,_ And to the end that this good order may be observed,
for the comfort and edification of the Society, in the ways of truth and soberness,
select meetings, of care and business, are fixed in all parts where we inhabit,
which are held monthly, and which resolve into Quarterly Meetings,
and those into one Yearly Meeting, for our better communication one with another,
in those things that maintain piety and charity; that God, who by his grace,
has called us to be a people to his praise, may have it from us, through his beloved Son,
and our ever-blessed and only Redeemer, Jesus Christ, for he is worthy, worthy,
now and ever.
Amen.

Thus, reader, thou hast the character of the people called Quakers, in their doctrine,
worship, ministry, practice and discipline;
compare it with Scripture and primitive example, and we hope thou wilt find,
that this short discourse hath, in good measure, answered the title of it,
viz. "`Primitive Christianity revived,
in the principles and practice of the people called Quakers.`"

William Penn about this time paid a visit to Peter the great, Czar of Russia.
This extraordinary man took the singular resolution
of visiting several parts of Europe in person,
for the purpose of becoming acquainted with the arts,
which were but very imperfectly understood in his own country.

Having resided for sometime in Holland, where he worked in one of the dock-yards,
at the building of ships, he went over to England,
and engaged in a similar employment at Deptford.
He at times visited London,
and resided at a large building which was provided for his accommodation.
At one of these times, Gilbert Molleson, brother-in-law to Robert Barclay,
having understood that a relation of his was in the service of the Czar,
concluded that he might possibly find means through his instrumentality,
to introduce some of the writings of Friends into the family and dominions of Peter.
He therefore in company with Thomas Story, went one morning to the residence of the Czar;
and upon inquiring for Gilbert`'s relation, they were introduced to an Englishman,
who had resided in Russia as a merchant, and having there become known to the Czar,
was then serving him as his interpreter.
During their conference, Peter and Prince Menzikoff, his general, came to them,
and by some questions which were put to them by the merchant,
apparently at the suggestion of the Czar,
gave Thomas an opportunity of explaining the principles of Friends on one or two points,
particularly in relation to war.
They afterwards presented to the merchant, for the use of the Czar,
two copies of Barclay`'s Apology in latin,
with a request that in case any of their friends should come into his dominions,
and preach the doctrines contained in that book,
and be persecuted on that account by any persons acting under his authority,
he would be kind enough to afford them protection and relief.
On the first-day following, the Czar and Prince Menzikoff, with the same interpreter,
came to the meeting at Gracechurch street, where Thomas Story happened to be.
A Friend had just begun to speak when they came in,
and without knowing that such distinguished auditors were present,
delivered a testimony well adapted to the occasion.
The interpreter probably informed the Czar the substance of the Friend`'s testimony,
for they were observed to be often whispering to each other.
Several persons afterwards crowding into the house from the street,
with a view of gazing at the Russian monarch,
he withdrew before the meeting was quite done.

After his return to Deptford, William Penn being informed of these circumstances,
and understanding that he was not acquainted with the latin language,
in which the Apology presented was written,
went in company with George Whitehead and some other Friends to that place,
and waited on him privately.
As they were informed that he understood the German language,
they presented him with some copies of the Apology in that tongue, which he accepted.^
footnote:[Thomas Clarkson adds to this account,
that a conversation ensued between the Czar and William Penn, in the high Dutch language,
which the latter spoke fluently.]
He afterwards sometimes attended the meetings of Friends in that place,
conducting entirely as a private person.

From the curiosity manifested by that great man,
to see whatever was to be seen in the countries which he visited,
we need not be surprised that he should sometimes attend the meetings of Friends;
yet we have at a subsequent period,
sufficient evidence that this transient acquaintance with Friends,
left a favourable impression on his mind.
For about sixteen years after this time, being at Frederickstadt, in Holstein,
whither he had gone with five thousand men, to assist the Danes against the Swedes,
when he had quartered his men,
he inquired of one of the burgomasters whether there were any Quakers there.
Upon being told there were a few,
he next inquired whether they had a meeting in that place; and was informed they had.
It being the first-day of the week, he directed information to be given to Friends,
that if they would appoint a meeting to be held that forenoon he would attend it.
He was told in return, that the meeting-house was occupied by thirty of his soldiers;
upon which he sent one of his captains with positive orders
for the soldiers to leave the place without delay,
and to take their baggage with them.
Friends were immediately informed of this proceeding,
and arrangements were made for holding a meeting there at two o`'clock.
The Czar accordingly came with Prince Menzikoff, General Dolgorouky,
and several dukes and other men in conspicuous stations,
followed by a great number of others.
When as many were convened as the house would accommodate,
he directed the doors to be closed.
The Czar sat very gravely during the time of silence;
and his attendants awed by his presence and example, did so likewise.
After some time passed in silence, a Friend who resided in the town,
rose and preached to the people.
The Czar appeared particularly attentive,
and as he understood the language in which the Friend spoke, probably the high Dutch,
which his lords did not, he interpreted it to them with much seriousness and gravity;
saying that whoever lived according to that doctrine would be happy.
Though so much of the life of this monarch was passed in the hurry and turmoil of war,
yet he was willing to commend the doctrines of the Gospel as they were
professed and declared by a humble member of the Society of Friends.

The year 1697, appears to have passed away,
without leaving any important memorial of the labours of William Penn.
He seems to have been at this time an inhabitant of the city of Bristol.
This we may remember was the residence of his second wife, previous to their marriage.
One instance however remains in evidence of his continued
attention to the interests of the Society to which he belonged.

A bill was about this time introduced into the British parliament,
for the punishment of blasphemy.
Upon inspecting the provisions of it, he discovered that if enacted into a law,
it might and probably would be made the instrument of persecution,
by subjecting to the punishment of blasphemers,
many persons who fully acknowledged the Gospel Truths
which that bill was intended to protect from profanation,
but who dissented from the terms in which they were couched.
He therefore wrote a short essay entitled "`Some considerations upon the
bill for the more effectual suppressing of blasphemy and profaneness;
humbly offered,`" in which he pointed out the ill
use that he apprehended might be made of it,
advised that in case it was passed into a law,
the Creed should be expressed in the exact words of Scripture,
and showed the inefficiency of the bill in its existing form,
to the attainment of its ostensible object.
This essay was probably sent to the members of parliament,
for whose information it was prepared.
What impression it made cannot be certainly known,
but we find the bill was soon afterwards dropped.

In the early part of 1698, he left home to pay a religious visit to Ireland,
having John Everot and Thomas Story as companions.
They reached Dublin on the 6th of third month,
and on the 8th attended the Half year`'s Meeting at that place, where,
as Thomas Story informs us, they were greatly comforted,
not only in the enjoyment of the blessed presence of the Lord,
but also in observing the unity, mildness,
and order which appeared among Friends in the management of the affairs of the church.

The presence of William Penn drew great numbers of people of all ranks and professions,
to the meetings at Dublin,
and he was so furnished with wisdom and utterance as fully to answer their expectations.
Many of the clergy attended, and the people generally expressed their approbation,
of the doctrine which they heard.
Of the clergy, the dean of Derry was one; who was several times at the meetings there;
and being afterwards asked by his bishop,
whether he heard any thing in those meetings but blasphemy and nonsense;
and whether he took off his hat in time of prayer; he answered,
that he heard neither blasphemy nor nonsense, but the everlasting Truth;
and that he not only look off his hat at prayer,
but his heart said amen to what he heard.
This ecclesiastic appeared convinced that the principles
professed by Friends were sound and true;
yet he was not willing to lose his living and character
on account of the peculiarities which they held.
Thus proving unfaithful in the day of small things, he advanced no further.

In the intervals of meetings,
William Penn visited the lords justices of Ireland
and the principal officers of the government,
to interest them, as far as he was able, in the principles and members of the Society.

But he was not permitted to proceed without opposition
in the work wherein he was then engaged.
For John Plympton, whom he had silenced at Melksham, between two and three years before,
published, soon after his arrival,
a paper containing some invidious reflections on Friends in general,
and upon William Penn in particular;
treating him with epithets inconsistent with common civility.
In consequence of this, several Friends, of whom Thomas Story was one,
went to the elders of the Society to which Plympton belonged,
and afterwards to their meeting,
and inquired whether this publication was made with their consent.
They modestly answered that it was altogether his own work,
with which they disavowed any connection.
Friends therefore concluded to take no further notice of the man;
but they published soon afterwards, a single sheet,
under the title of "`Gospel Truths,`" consisting of eleven propositions,
in which the principal points of doctrine as held by the Society of Friends,
are concisely stated; being couched in scriptural language,
or confirmed by appropriate quotations chiefly from the New Testament.
This paper was mostly drawn up by William Penn,
and signed by him and three other Friends; it is as follows:

=== Gospel Truths.

Sober reader, if thou hadst rather we should be in the right than in the wrong;
and if thou thinkest it but a reasonable thing that
we should be heard before we are condemned,
and that our belief ought to be taken from our own mouths,
and not at theirs who have prejudged our cause; then we entreat thee,
to read and weigh the following brief account of those things
that are chiefly received and professed among us,
the people called Quakers, according to the testimony of the Scriptures of Truth,
and the illumination of the Holy Ghost,
which are the double and agreeing record of true religion.
Published to inform the moderate inquirer, and reclaim the prejudiced to a better temper;
which God grant, to his glory and their peace.

without money, and without price. John 4:23-24.

John Plympton also published a paper which he called,
_A Quaker No Christian;_ which William Penn answered by another entitled,
_The Quaker a Christian._
He also reprinted the eighth and ninth chapters of his Primitive Christianity Revived;
which satisfied the people generally, that Plympton`'s charges were groundless.

From Dublin William Penn proceeded toward the county of Wexford, and on the 29th,
had a large and favoured meeting at Lamb`'s-town.
Here he received a visit from Colonel Butler,
an Irishman of the Roman Catholic persuasion,
who had been kind to the English in general, and to Friends in particular,
during the late wars in that country.

On the 1st of fourth month,
he and his companions had a large and satisfactory meeting at Wexford.
Soon after this they addressed the following epistle to the Yearly Meeting of London.

[.salutation]
Dear friends and brethren,

It is not the least of our exercises that we are thus far outwardly
separated from you at this time of your holy and blessed solemnity:
but because we have great reason to believe it is in the will of God,
we humbly submit to his ordering hand, and with open arms of deep and tender love,
embrace you, our living, and our loving brethren,
who are given up to serve the Lord in your generation, and have long preferred Jerusalem,
and the peace and prosperity, of her borders, above your chiefest joy.
The salutation of our endeared brotherly love in Christ Jesus, is unto you,
desiring that he may richly appear among you in power, wisdom and love,
to guide your judgments and influence your spirits, in this weighty anniversary assembly,
that so nothing may appear, or have place among you,
but what singly seeks the honour of the Lord, the exaltation of his Truth,
and the peace and establishment of his heritage.
For this, brethren, you and we know, has been the aim,
end and practice of those whom the Lord hath made
willing to forsake and give up all for his name`'s-sake;
and through various exercises and tribulations, yea, in the way of the daily cross,
and through the fight and baptism of manifold afflictions,
to have their conversation and sojourning here below upon the earth, in fear and love;
looking for their reward in the heavens, that shall never pass away,
who have not been lifted up by good report, nor cast down by evil report,
from their love to the Lord and his precious Truth; but hold on their way,
and whose hands being clean of evil things towards all men,
have waxed stronger and stronger in the Lord.
Wherefore, dear brethren, let us all be found in the same steps,
and walking the same way, not being high-minded, but fearing to the end,
that we may serve our generation in diligence and faithfulness,
and so enter into the rest that God has reserved
for his true travellers and labourers in his vineyard.

And now, dear brethren,
know that the Lord hath brought us well into this kingdom of Ireland,
and given us many large and blessed opportunities in several parts,
meetings being crowded by people of all ranks and persuasions, especially at Dublin, who,
for aught we have heard, have given the Truth a good report;
and indeed the Lord has mightily appeared for his own name,
and owned us with more than an ordinary presence, suitable to the occasions,
and made very heavy and hard things easy to us, because of the glory of his power,
with which he assisted us in our needful times; for which our souls bow before him,
and bless, reverence and praise his holy and worthy name.
So that dear brethren, we have good tidings to give you of Truth`'s prosperity at large,
and more especially in the churches,
having had the comfort of the General Meeting of this nation,
consisting of many weighty brethren and sisters, from all parts thereof,
which was held in the city of Dublin in much love, peace and unity for several days;
wherein we had occasion to observe their commendable care,
for the prosperity of the blessed Truth, in all the branches of its holy testimony,
both in the general, and in the particular,
improving the good order practised among the churches of Christ in our nation.

Indeed their simplicity, gravity and coolness, in managing their church affairs;
their diligence in meetings, both for worship and business;
their dispatch in ending differences, and expedients to prevent them,
but especially their zeal against covetousness, and indifferency in Truth`'s service,
and exemplary care,
to discourage immoderate concern in pursuit of the things of this life,
and to excite Friends to do good with what they have, very greatly comforted us.
And in the sweet and blessed power of Christ Jesus, the meeting ended,
and Friends departed.
The Lord grant that you may also see of the travail of your
souls and end of your labour and service of love,
who seek not your own things, but the things of Jesus Christ,
in this your solemn General Meeting.

And, dear brethren, we must tell you,
here is room enough for true labourers in God`'s vineyard,
and cannot well forbear to recommend the service of Truth in this nation,
to your serious consideration,
if haply the Lord may put it into the hearts of any faithful and weighty brethren,
to visit it in the word of eternal life; for we cannot but say,
the harvest appears to us to be great, and the labourers in comparison but few:
so in that love which many waters cannot quench,
nor distance wear out of our remembrances,
and in which we desire to be remembered of you to the Lord of our household,
we dearly and tenderly salute and embrace you, and remain,

[.signed-section-closing]
Your loving and faithful brethren,

[.signed-section-signature]
William Penn, John Everot, Thomas Story.

P.S. Friends here have been zealous and liberal in printing and re-printing,

which we hope will also fall under your consideration.

Proceeding in company with several other Friends towards Waterford,
where a meeting was appointed to be held at five o`'clock in the afternoon,
they met with a curious adventure.
The parliament of Ireland had made a law,
that no papist should be allowed to keep a horse
worth more than five pounds and five shillings,
and that where any papist was found to be in possession
of a horse of that or a greater value,
any person, being a protestant, might give information thereof upon oath,
to two of their magistrates, and upon paying or tendering that sum to the possessor,
in the presence of such magistrates,
the ownership of the horse should be vested in the informer.
They dined at Ross, which lies on the east side of the bay,
Waterford being some distance below on the west.
While they were at dinner,
four of their horses were seized professedly by virtue of that law.
Two of the horses thus seized,
being worth little more than the maximum value of a papist`'s horse,
were given up to their owners: but the other two, belonging to William Penn and his son,
who appears to have been in the company, were detained as a much more valuable prize.
Several horses belonging to some of the company,
had been sent over before the seizure was made.
William Penn and John Everot, therefore went on to attend the meeting at Waterford,
leaving some of the rest to attend to the horses which were detained.
They called upon the officer who granted the warrant, where the informers,
two military officers, also appeared, and took out a replevin,
by which means they regained possession of the horses,
and went on to Waterford the same afternoon;
but the meeting was over before their arrival.
The officers thus prevented from obtaining immediate possession of William Penn`'s horses,
were much enraged, and threatened loudly that they would recover them by law.
But William Penn was too well known,
to be fleeced of his property under the character of a papist.
He wrote to the lords justices of Ireland, complaining of the abuse,
and they issued an order confining those officers to their chambers,
and commanded them to decline the suit.
They were thus confined for several weeks,
and at length made application to William Penn,
through the medium of some Friends of Cork, and the governor of Waterford,
for his intercession with the lords justices for their release.
As they appeared to be sensible of their fault, and had withdrawn the suit at Ross,
he made the application desired, and procured their discharge.

The meeting at Waterford was very large;
the public service of which fell upon William Penn.
It was reported that the bishop of the place,
and several of his clergy were in his garden, where they could hear what was said,
without showing themselves as part of the audience.

From Waterford, they proceeded by way of Clonmel, to Youghall;
and on the way passed through some desolate country, where as they were afterwards told,
a number of rapparees were lying in ambush for the purpose of seizing William Penn,
under the impression that in case they effected his
capture they would obtain a great prize.
As he was known to possess a large estate in Ireland,
these freebooters probably supposed that he carried a large sum with him on his journey.
But there were a number of Friends belonging to the company,
who from various causes passed the place in detached parties;
so that the rapparees did not venture to molest them.

While in that country William Penn took an opportunity of visiting his estates there,^
footnote:[An anecdote related to Thomas Story, at Shannenguay, on William Penn`'s estate,
by a gentlewoman of good understanding and character,
appears worthy of recital.
{footnote-paragraph-split}
She was in
the city of Cork when it was invested by King William`'s army;
and was sitting with a little daughter by her side,
under great solicitude on account of their dangerous situation,
when she was seized with a sudden fear, and a strong impulse to leave the seat,
which she did in a precipitate manner, and hastened to another part of the room.
She then felt a like concern for her child,
whom she called with uncommon earnestness to come to her; immediately afterwards,
a cannon ball struck the seat where they had been sitting,
and scattered its fragments about the room, but did no injury to either of them.]
but spent only three days on one, and two on the other;
and going forward held meetings at sundry places, till he arrived at Cork.
In that city, on the first-day subsequent to his arrival,
they had a very crowded meeting, where according to the testimony of Thomas Story,
the Lord was mightily with him, clothing him with holy zeal and divine wisdom,
to the great satisfaction of Friends, and the admiration of the people.

On the 3rd of fifth month, he had a large and good meeting at Charleyville,
which would have been larger but for the management of the priest of the place.
The meetings there began after the worship of others was over;
but on that day the priest began his sermon rather earlier than usual,
and continued to speak until the meeting of Friends was nearly over.
But he gained nothing by his craft; for those who were thus detained,
hearing from others a high character of the ministry of William Penn,
were much displeased with their own pastor;
and one of those who attended Friends`' meeting told him to his face,
that Mr. Penn preached better than he did.
In the evening they had another meeting at the same place, and thence went to Limerick,
where they had a laborious meeting on the 5th. From Limerick they went to Birr,
where they had a satisfactory meeting in the townhall, which the chief magistrate,
at the instance of William Penn, permitted them to use for that purpose.
The priest of the parish, and several persons of quality attended;
and the former came in the evening to see William Penn and discourse with him.
William gave him a small book explanatory of Friends`' principles,
which he thankfully received, and took a very respectful leave of him.

Next day they went to Rosenallis, to the habitation of that worthy ancient Friend,
William Edmundson, where William Penn remained until the 10th,
when he and his companions attended a large meeting at Mountmellick,
the company being mostly Friends.

On the following day they proceeded to Edenderry,
where they had a large meeting with Friends and others, divers persons of quality,
and two Episcopalian priests being of the number.
One of these ministers, an ancient man,
tenderly confessed the truth of the doctrine which he heard.

They went next to Lurgan, passing through a wild, mountainous country,
and had a large meeting there, about two-thirds of the assembly being Friends;
in which meeting the ministry of William Penn is described as particularly refreshing.
A number of professors of different persuasions, being at that meeting,
were convinced that Friends had been much misrepresented in the reports of the day,
with regard to their principles, doctrines and manners.

They reached Dublin late in the evening on the seventh-day of the week,
where their arrival soon became sufficiently known to collect a
large company at each of the meetings on the following day;
to which many strangers came.
Having remained a few days in that city,
they left it and visited Friends at their meetings in sundry places,
till they came to Cashel.
They were there on the first-day of the week;
and a great company filled the house at a very early hour.
The bishop of the place, going the same morning to his worship,
his hour of meeting being probably something earlier than that of Friends,
found the house almost empty,
for his auditors were gone or going to the meeting of Friends,
so that he had nobody to preach to, but the mayor,
the church wardens and a few constables.
This making him angry,
he sent the mayor and constables to break up the meeting of Friends.
When the mayor got to the meeting, William Penn had not come in,
but was in an adjoining room.
John Vaughton, a Friend from London, was preaching to the people.
The mayor could not make his way to the interior of the house, for the throng;
but made his proclamation, commanding them, in the king`'s name, to disperse.
The people did not appear disposed to regard the mayor`'s proclamation,
but kept their places;
and John Vaughton related to him the substance of a conference
which he and some other Friends had with the king,
in which he assured them, that if they should be disturbed in their religious assemblies,
and would acquaint him with it, he would lake care to protect them.
He then appealed to the mayor and the audience, to judge whether they ought to obey him,
without law, or to accept the royal protection according to law.
The mayor did not appear pleased with the business in which he was engaged,
having undertaken it in compliance with the command of the bishop,
and very readily yielded to a request from William Penn
to speak with him in the room where he still was.
William Penn treated him with the respect due to his office,
and requested that he would retire,
and let the bishop know that he would call upon him when their meeting was over;
which the mayor accordingly did.
William Penn, who had been writing some letters of importance,
while the meeting was gathering, then went in, and they had a comfortable meeting,
the people appearing generally satisfied with what they heard and felt.

When the meeting was over, William Penn taking two or three Friends with him,
called on the bishop,
and expostulated with him concerning his conduct in sending the
mayor to disturb their meeting in the manner he had done.
The bishop apparently convinced that his conduct was not justifiable,
acknowledged that he was displeased with the smallness of his auditory,
and sent the mayor to disperse their meeting in order to increase his own;
but professed to have no ill will to William Penn or to the members of his profession.

But the bishop reflecting afterwards that such a
transaction would probably excite considerable notice,
and being convinced that unless the meeting was attended with some unusual circumstances,
his interference would be judged unlawful, he wrote to the earl of Galloway,
and the other lord justice of Ireland, informing them,
"`That Mr. Penn and the Quakers had gathered such a multitude of people,
and so many armed papists, that it struck a terror into him and the town;
and not knowing what the consequence might be,
he sent the mayor and other magistrates to disperse them;
but seeing they had taken no notice of him, or of the civil powers there,
he thought it his duty to lay the matter before their lordships,
that such remedies might be applied, as they in their wisdom might think proper,
to obviate the danger and ill consequences of such assemblies.`"
This letter the earl afterwards showed to William Penn,
who thereupon related the particulars of the case,
informing the earl that he saw no armed persons there,
unless perhaps a few gentlemen with swords as was usual;
but knew nothing of their religious profession.
This account satisfied the earl that the bishop`'s
interference was altogether needless and impertinent.

From Cashel, William Penn and his companions went towards Cork,
taking meetings in their way;
and continued in that city and the neighbourhood until the 19th of sixth month,
when they embarked for their native land.
Just as he was leaving Ireland, a letter was received from the bishop of Cork,
containing some severe animadversions upon the paper called
"`Gospel Truths,`" which he had put into his hands.
These strictures were not a private communication, but printed and published;
and the copy which then came to hand was, no doubt, a printed one.
In this work the bishop made no inconsiderable profession of charity and moderation;
yet he manifested stronger symptoms of bigotry and intolerance, than of moderation;
putting constructions upon several parts of that paper,
which ill accorded with a spirit of charity.

As William Penn had an esteem for the man,
he must have been much grieved to find his friendly visit,
and the information offered to him, so ungraciously received.
But there was no time for answering it then.
In two days from their embarkation, they landed at Minehead;
from whence William Penn and Thomas Story proceeded, without much delay,
to his residence at Bristol.

One of his earliest employments after reaching home,
was to prepare a reply to the bishop of Cork.
In this he had the assistance of Thomas Story,
at least in transcribing the sheets and looking out for the appropriate texts,
if not in the arrangement of the arguments.
Great part of this paper is occupied in exposing
the unsound and uncandid statements of the bishop;
yet there are some parts of it of general importance,
and explanatory of the doctrines of Friends.
The subjects of baptism and the supper, in particular,
are treated with great clearness and force.
It is indeed questionable whether those points are as forcibly
illustrated in any other part of William Penn`'s works.

A few weeks after the publication of this tract we find him at Deptford,
in company with some Friends who were about to embark for America.
Among this number was Thomas Story,
his particular friend and late companion in his visit to Ireland.
The latter had been for some time under a religious concern to visit that continent,
and was then on board a ship at Deptford, nearly ready to sail.
Previous to separating, Friends had a religious opportunity together in the cabin,
where they were greatly tendered and comforted by
the sensible effusions of heavenly love.
After a season of retirement,
William Penn was engaged in vocal prayer for the good and preservation of all,
and especially for those who were then about to leave them;
with thanksgiving also for all the favours of God,
and for that holy and precious enjoyment in addition to his many former blessings.
Under the tendering impressions thus experienced, they parted;
leaving Friends to commence their voyage under a fresh assurance
that they were going on their Master`'s business.

About this time sundry works made their appearance,
in which the doctrines of Friends were much misrepresented, as well as their character.
One of these was published by Francis Bugg, who had formerly professed with Friends,
but had several years before apostatized from them.
Another called "`The Snake in the Grass,`" was published anonymously,
but the author was discovered to be a nonjuring clergyman.^
footnote:[The nonjuring clergymen,
were such as refused to take the oath of allegiance to William III.,
and were ejected from their livings on that account.]
This latter work was answered by George Whitehead and Joseph Wyeth.
William Penn also produced the following short essay, entitled:

[.asterism]
'''

[.old-style]
=== A Testimony to the Truth of God, / as held by the people called Quakers: being a short vindication of them, from the abuses and misrepresentations often put upon them by envious apostates, and mercenary adversaries.

[.blurb]
=== To the Reader.

Occasion having been given us, which we never sought,
we continue to improve it to the further explanation
and defence of our so much abused profession;
that if possible people may see, at least the more sober and candid,
that we are not at that distance from Truth, nor so heterodox in our principles,
as we have been by too many, either rashly or interestedly represented:
but that we hold the great truths of Christianity, according to the Holy Scriptures,
and that the realities of religion are the mark we press after,
and to disabuse and awaken people from their false hopes and carnal securities,
under which they are too apt to indulge themselves, to their irreparable loss;
that by our setting Christian doctrine in a true light,
and reviving and pressing the necessity of a better practice,
they may see the obligation they are under to redeem the precious time they have lost,
by a more careful employment of that which remains, to a better purpose.
In this short vindication of our mistaken principles,
the ingenuous reader may easily discern how illy we have been treated,
and what hardships we have laboured under, through the prejudice of some,
and the unreasonable credulity of others, and that we are a people in earnest for heaven,
and in that way our blessed Lord trod for us to glory.

[.blurb]
=== A Testimony To the Truth of God, etc.

By the observation we are led to make from Francis Bugg`'s late book,
upon the bishop of Norwich giving him his recommendatory letter to the clergy, etc,
in his diocess, to relieve by a collection, the necessities of that apostate;
a copy of which letter the said Francis Bugg has published in his said book;
and also by the observation we have made on the malicious
attempts of the '`Snake in the Grass,`' in his first,
second and third editions,
which is a disingenuous and unjust collection from Francis Bugg,
and some other deserters, of things for the most part, long since answered;
as also lately, by the book entitled, '`An Antidote,`' etc.

And lastly,
by the observation we have made on the relation subscribed by some of the Norfolk clergy,
dated October the 12th, 1698; we cannot forbear thinking,
that as their confederacy is deep,
so it aims at nothing less than the ruin of us and our posterity,
by rendering us blasphemers and enemies to the government, and to be treated as such.

The Norfolk relation from the clergy aforesaid, charges the said people with blasphemy:
first, against God.
Secondly, against Jesus Christ.
Thirdly, against the Holy Scriptures; with contempt of civil magistracy,
and the ordinances which Jesus Christ instituted, viz. baptism by water,
and the Lord`'s supper by bread and wine.
And lastly, that the light within, as taught by us, leaves us without any certain rule,
and exposes us to the blasphemies aforesaid, with many others.

Now because these charges refer to doctrine rather than fact, or particular persons,
we think ourselves concerned to say something in vindication of our profession,
and to wipe off the dirt thereby intended to be cast upon us,
in giving our reader a plain account of our principles,
free from the perversions of our enemies.

But to manifest how uncharitably and unjustly the said clergymen
have reflected upon the people called Quakers,
with respect to the said charges,
we are contented that the reader should go no further than their own printed relation,
dated November 12th, 1698, not doubting but by that and the letters therewith printed,
he will meet with entire satisfaction,
with respect to the reasonableness and justice of
the Quakers`' proceedings in that affair,
and how ready they were to come to the test,
and to bring the pretended charge upon the stage,
and to purge themselves from the guilt of the same:
provided they might be accommodated with what the common law allows malefactors,
viz. a copy of their indictment; but this could not be obtained.
And though the said clergy have thought fit to print the charge in general,
without any proof, we think ourselves obliged to vindicate our profession,
by freely declaring, as now we do, without any mental reservation,
our sincere belief of the very things they most unjustly charge us with denying.

[.numbered-group]
====

[.numbered]
1+++.+++ _Concerning God._
Because we declare, that God is a God nigh at hand,
and that he is according to his promise,
become the teacher of his people by his Spirit in these latter days;
and that true believers are the temples for him to walk and dwell in,
as the apostle teacheth;
experiencing something of the accomplishment of this great and glorious Truth among us,
and have therefore pressed people earnestly to the knowledge and enjoyment thereof,
as the blessing and glory of these latter days; we have been ignorantly,
or maliciously represented and treated as heretics and blasphemers,
as if we owned no God in heaven above the stars,
and confined the holy One of Israel to our beings:
Whereas we believe him to be the eternal, incomprehensible, almighty,
all-wise and omnipresent God, the Creator and upholder of all things,
and that he fills heaven and earth, and that the heaven of heavens cannot contain him;
yet he saith by the prophet Isaiah, "`To that man will I look, that is poor,
and of a contrite spirit, and who trembles at my word.`"
So that for professing that which is the very marrow of the Christian religion,
viz. Emmanuel, God with us, we are represented as blasphemers against that God;
with whom we leave our innocent and suffering cause.
Isaiah 7:1,14. 28. 58:17. 66:1,2. 2 Cor. 6:16. Rev. 21:8.

[.numbered]
2+++.+++ _Concerning Jesus Christ._
Because we believe that the Word which was made flesh, and dwelt amongst men,
and was and is the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and Truth; his beloved Son,
in whom he is well pleased, and whom we ought to hear in all things;
who tasted death for every man, and died for sin, that we might die to sin;
is the great Light of the world, and full of grace and truth;
and that he lighteth every man that cometh into the world,
and giveth them grace for grace, and light for light,
and that no man can know God and Christ, whom to know is life eternal, and themselves,
in order to true conviction and conversion,
without receiving and obeying this holy light, and being taught by the Divine grace;
and that without it, no remission, no justification, no salvation, can be obtained,
as the Scripture plentifully testifies;
and because we therefore press the necessity of people`'s receiving
the inward and spiritual appearance of this Divine Word,
in order to a right and beneficial application of whatsoever he did for man,
with respect to his life, miracles, sufferings, death, resurrection,
ascension and mediation; our adversaries would have us deny any Christ without us.
First, as to his Divinity, because they make us to confine him within us.
Secondly, as to his humanity or manhood, because as he was the son of Abraham,
David and Mary, according to the flesh, he cannot be in us,
and therefore we are heretics and blasphemers.

Whereas we believe him, according to Scripture, to be the son of Abraham, David and Mary,
after the flesh, and also God over all, blessed forever.
So that he that is within us, is also without us,
even the same who laid down his precious life for us, rose again from the dead,
and ever liveth to make intercession for us,
being the blessed and alone Mediator between God and man,
and him by whom God will finally judge the world, both quick and dead:
all which we as sincerely and steadfastly believe, as any other society of people,
whatever may be ignorantly or maliciously insinuated to the contrary,
either by our declared enemies or mistaken neighbours. Duet. 15:18.
Mic. 5:2. John 1:1-3. Rev. 22:16.

[.numbered]
3+++.+++ _Concerning the Holy Spriptures._
Because we assert the Holy Spirit to be the first
great and general rule and guide of true Christians,
as that by which God is worshipped, sin detected, conscience convicted, duty manifested,
Scripture unfolded and explained,
and consequently the rule for understanding the Scriptures themselves,
since by it they were at first given forth;
from hence our adversaries are pleased to make us blasphemers of the Holy Scriptures,
undervaluing their authority, and preferring our own books before them,
with more to that purpose.

Whereas, we in truth and sincerity believe them to be of Divine authority,
given by the inspiration of God, through holy men;
they speaking or writing them as they were moved by the Holy Ghost:
that they are a declaration of those things most surely believed by the primitive Christians,
and that as they contain the mind and will of God, and are his commands to us,
so they in that respect, are his declaratory word; and therefore are obligatory on us,
and are '`profitable for doctrine, reproof, correction and instruction in righteousness,
that the man of God may be perfect, and thoroughly furnished to every good work.`'

Nay, after all, so unjust is the charge,
and so remote from our belief concerning the Holy Scriptures, that we love,
honour and prefer them, before all books in the world;
ever choosing to express our belief of the Christian
faith and doctrine in the terms thereof,
and rejecting all principles or doctrines whatsoever, that are repugnant thereunto.

Nevertheless, we are well persuaded,
that notwithstanding there is such an excellency in the Holy Scriptures,
as we have above declared,
yet the unstable and unlearned in Christ`'s school often wrest them to their own destruction;
and upon our reflection on their carnal constructions of them,
we are made undervalues of Scripture itself.
But certain it is,
that as the Lord hath been pleased to give us the
experience of the fulfilling of them in measure,
so it is altogether contrary to our faith and practice,
to put any manner of slight or contempt upon them,
much more to be guilty of what maliciously is suggested against us;
since no society of professed Christians in the world,
can have a more reverend and honourable esteem for them than we have.

Iii. 16, 17. 2 Pet. 3:16.

[.numbered]
4+++.+++ _Concerning magistracy._
Because we have not actively complied with divers statutes,
which have been made to force an uniformity to what we had no faith in,
but the testimony of our consciences is against, and because, for conscience sake,
we could not give those marks of honour and respect,
which were and are the usual practice of those who seek honour one of another,
and not that honour which comes from God only,
but measure and weigh honour and respect in a false balance and deceitful measure,
on which, neither magistrate, ruler nor people can depend; we say,
because we could not for conscience sake, give flattering titles, etc,
we have been rendered as despisers and contemners of magistracy: whereas our principles,
often repeated upon the many revolutions that have happened,
do evidently manifest the contrary,
as well as our peaceable behaviour from the beginning,
under all the various forms of government, hath been an undeniable plea in our favour,
when those that also have professed the same principles
of non-resistance and passive obedience,
have quitted their principles,
and yet quarrel with us upon a supposition that we will in time, write after their copy;
which, as nothing is more contrary to our principles, faith and doctrine,
so nothing can be more contrary to our constant practice.

For we not only really believe magistracy to be an ordinance of God,
but esteem it an extraordinary blessing, where it is a praise to them that do well,
and a terror to evil-doers: and that it may be so in this our native land,
is the fervent desire of our souls,
that the blessing and peace of God may be continued thereupon. Job 32:21.
John 5:44. Acts 5:29. 1 Pet. 2:13-14.

[.numbered]
5+++.+++ _Concerning baptism._
Because we do not find in any place in the four Evangelists,
that Jesus Christ instituted baptism by water, to come in the room of circumcision,
or to be the baptism proper to his kingdom, which stands in righteousness,
peace and joy in the Holy Ghost;
we are therefore rendered as contemners of Christ`'s baptism:
Whereas the baptism of Jesus Christ, of which he was Lord and administrator,
according to the nature of his office and kingdom,
is by John the Baptist declared to be that of fire, not water, and of the Holy Ghost;
of which water baptism was but the forerunner, and is, by them that now practice it,
called but the outward and visible sign of the inward and spiritual grace;
and therefore not the grace itself: which grace, as the apostle saith,
is sufficient for us, and we believe,
profess and experience it to be come by Jesus Christ,
who is the substance of all signs and shadows to true believers;
he being no more a Jew or Christian who is one outwardly,
by the cutting or washing of the flesh; but he is a Jew or Christian who is one inwardly,
and circumcision and baptism are of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter,
whose praise is therefore not of men, but of God:
and this baptism Christ preferred and recommended at his farewell to his disciples:
in reverence and duty to whom, to say nothing of the abuse of water baptism,
we decline the use thereof. Mark 1:8.
Luke 3:16. John 1:17. Acts 1:5. Rom.
14:17. Rom. 2:28-29. 1 Cor. 1:17. 2 Cor. 12:9.

[.numbered]
6+++.+++ _Concerning breaking bread, etc._
Because we also disuse the outward ceremony of breaking bread and drinking wine,
which is commonly called the Lord`'s supper,
we are therefore rendered deniers and contemners of the Lord`'s supper:
Whereas the inward and spiritual grace thereby signified,
viz. That bread which came down from heaven,
which Christ prefers to the bread the fathers ate in the wilderness,
which did not keep them from death,
and that cup which he promised to drink new with his disciples in his Father`'s kingdom,
we not only believe, but reverently partake of, to our unspeakable comfort.
This is rightly and truly the communion of the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who said, '`Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood,
ye have no life in you.`' For it is the Spirit that quickens, the flesh profits nothing.
It is also his promise to all those who open at his knocks, That he will come in,
and sup with them; which inward and spiritual coming,
we have both known and testified to, feeling the blessed effects thereof in our souls.
And knowing that the outward breaking of bread and drinking of wine,
in the way commonly practised, is no more than it is declared to be,
viz. '`An outward and visible sign;`' why then, should any contend about it,
and render us unchristian,
for disusing what themselves allow to be but '`an outward and visible
sign?`' None can reasonably believe it to be an essential part of religion,
as is the bread from heaven; of which the outward is, at best, but a signification:
but the wine that Christ promised to drink new with his disciples, is such an essential,
that without it none have, nor can have eternal life. Matt. 26:29.
Mark 14:25. John 6:41,50,51,58,63. Rev. 3:20.

[.numbered]
7+++.+++ _Concerning the light of Christ._
Because we assert the sufficiency of the light within, it being the light of Christ,
viz. That if men live up to the teaching thereof,
in all manner of faithfulness and obedience, they shall not abide in darkness,
but have the light of life and salvation,
and the blood of Christ shall cleanse them from all sin;
our adversaries from thence conceive,
that we undervalue the rule of Holy Scriptures and all outward means,
as having no need thereof, since we have such a means and rule within us;
and that this leaves us without any certain rule, and exposeth us to many blasphemies, etc.
Whereas the light within, or Christ by his light inwardly teaching,
was never taught by us in opposition to, or contempt of, any outward means that God,
in his wisdom and providence, affords us for our edification and comfort,
no more than did that blessed apostle, who said, '`Ye need not that any man teach you,
but as the same anointing teacheth, you all things, and is truth, and is no lie.`'

[.numbered]
8+++.+++ _Concerning the Father, the Word, and the Spirit._
Because we have been very cautious in expressing our faith concerning that great mystery,
especially in such school terms and philosophical distinctions as are unscriptural,
if not unfounded,
the tendency whereof hath been to raise frivolous
controversies and animosities amongst men,
we have, by those that desire to lessen our Christian reputation,
been represented as deniers of the trinity at large.

Whereas we ever believed,
and as constantly maintained the truth of that blessed Holy Scripture.
Three, that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word and the Spirit,
and that these three are one; the which, we both sincerely and reverently believe,
according to 1 John 5:7. And this is sufficient for us to believe and know,
and hath a tendency to edification and holiness,
when the contrary centers only in imaginations and strife,
and in persecution where it runs high and to parties,
as may be read in bloody characters in the ecclesiastical histories.

[.numbered]
9+++.+++ _Concerning works._
Because we make evangelical obedience a condition to salvation;
and works wrought in us by the Spirit, to be an evidence of faith; and holiness of life,
to be both necessary and rewardable; it hath been insinuated against us,
as if we hoped to be saved by our own works,
and so make them the meritorious cause of our salvation,
and that consequently we are popish.

Whereas we know, that it is not by works of righteousness that we can do,
but by his own free grace is he pleased to accept of us through faith in,
and obedience to, his blessed Son the Lord Jesus Christ. Heb. 5:9.
and 12:14.

[.numbered]
10+++.+++ _Of Christ`'s being our example._
Because in some cases we have said the Lord Jesus was our great example,
and that his obedience to his Father doth not excuse ours;
but as by keeping his commandments, he abode in his Father`'s love,
so must we follow his example of obedience, and so abide in his love;
some have been so ignorant, or that which is worse, as to venture to say for us,
or in our name, that we believe our Lord Jesus Christ was, in all things, but an example.

Whereas we confess him to be so much more than an example,
that we believe him to be our most acceptable sacrifice to God his Father,
who for his sake, will look upon fallen man that hath justly merited the wrath of God,
upon his return by repentance, faith and obedience, as if he had never sinned at all. 1 John 2:12.
Rom. 3:26. and x. 9, 10. Heb. 5:9.

[.numbered]
11+++.+++ _Concerning freedom from sin._
Because we have urged the necessity of a perfect freedom from sin,
and a thorough sanctification in body, soul and spirit, whilst on this side the grave,
by the operation of the holy and perfect Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ,
according to the testimony of Holy Scripture; we are made so presumptuous,
as to assert the fulness of all perfection and happiness to only
sensible of those human infirmities that attend us,
whilst clothed with flesh and blood, but know that here we can only know in part,
and see in part: the perfection of wisdom, glory and happiness,
being reserved for another and better world. John 8:24-25.
Heb. 13:20-21. Heb. 6.

[.numbered]
12+++.+++ _Concerning worship to God._
Because we say with the apostle, that men ought to pray, preach, sing, etc,
with the Spirit, and that without the preparation and assistance of it,
no man can rightly worship God, all worship without it being formal and carnal,
from hence ignorance or envy suggests against us,
that if God will not compel us by his Spirit, he must go without his worship.

Whereas nothing can be more absurd, since without it no man can truly call Jesus Lord:
besides, it is our duty to wait upon him, who hath promised, not to compel,
but to fill them with renewings of strength, who so wait upon him,
by which they are made capable to worship him acceptably, be it in praying, preaching,
or praising of God: and how warrantable our practice herein is from Holy Scripture,
see Ps. 25:5. 37:7. 27:14. 130:5, 6. Hosea 12:6.

[.numbered]
13+++.+++ _Of God and Christ being in man._
Because we say, as do the Holy Scriptures, that God is light, and that Christ is light,
and that God is in Christ, and that Christ by his light,
lighteth every man that cometh into the world,
and dwelleth in them and with them that obey him,
in his inward and spiritual manifestations; people have been told by our adversaries,
that we believe every man has whole God and whole Christ in him,
and consequently so many Gods and Christs, as men.

Whereas we assert nothing herein,
but in the language of the Holy Ghost in the Scriptures of Truth; and mean no more by it,
than that as God is in Christ, so Christ by his Spirit and light,
dwelleth in the hearts of his people, to comfort and consolate them;
as he doth in wicked men, to reprove and condemn them, as well as to call,
enlighten and instruct them; that out of that state of condemnation they may come,
and by believing in him,
may experience their hearts cured of the maladies which sin hath brought upon them,
in order to complete salvation from sin here, and from wrath to come hereafter. 2 Cor. 5:9.
1 John 1:5.

[.numbered]
14+++.+++ _Of Christ`'s coming both in flesh and Spirit._
Because the tendency, generally speaking, of our ministry,
is to press people to the inward and spiritual appearance of Christ,
by his Spirit and grace in their hearts, to give them a true sight and sense of,
and sorrow for, sin, to amendment of life, and practice of holiness:
and because we have often opposed that doctrine of
being actually justified by the merits of Christ,
whilst actual sinners against God, and living in the pollutions of this wicked world:
we are,
by our adversaries rendered such as either deny or
undervalue the coming of Christ without us,
and the force and efficacy of his death and sufferings,
as a propitiation for the sins of the whole world.

Whereas we do, and hope we ever shall, as we always did,
confess to the glory of God the Father, and the honour of his dear and beloved Son,
that he, to wit, Jesus Christ took our nature upon him, and was like us in all things,
sin excepted; that he was born of the virgin Mary, went about amongst men doing good,
and working many miracles;
that he was betrayed by Judas into the hands of the chief priests,
etc. that he suffered death under Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor,
being crucified between two thieves,
and was buried in the sepulchre of Joseph of Arimathea;
rose again the third day from the dead, and ascended into heaven,
and sits at God`'s right hand, in the power and majesty of his Father; and that by him,
God the Father, will one day judge the whole world, both of quick and dead,
according to their works.

[.numbered]
15+++.+++ _Concerning the resurrection._
Because from the authority of Holy Scripture, as well as right reason,
we deny the resurrection of the same gross and corruptible body,
and are neither over inquisitive,
nor critical about what bodies we shall have at the resurrection, leaving it to the Lord,
to give us such bodies as he pleases, and with that we are well pleased and satisfied,
and wish all others were so too;
from hence we are made not only deniers of the resurrection of any body at all,
however spiritual or glorified, but eternal rewards too.

Whereas, if it were true, as it is notoriously false, we were, indeed, of all men,
most miserable: but, blessed be God, it is so far from being true,
that we most steadfastly believe, that as our Lord Jesus Christ was raised from the dead,
by the power of the Father, and was the first fruits of the resurrection,
so every man in his own order, shall arise; they that have done well,
to the resurrection of eternal life; but they that have done evil,
to everlasting condemnation.

And because we are a people,
whose education hath not afforded us an accuracy of language,
some passages may perhaps have been mis-expressed, or improperly worded: as for instance,
one of us hath denied in his book, the soul to be finite,
by which he plainly meant mortal or final, to die or have an end, which finis signifies,
from whence finite comes; our uncharitable opposers have concluded,
we hold the soul to be infinite, and consequently God:
whereas the words before and after, as well as the nature of the things, show plainly,
he only meant that it is not finite; that is, not terminable,
or that which shall come to an end.

And also, because we have not declared ourselves about matters of faith,
in the many and critical words that man`'s wisdom teacheth,
but in the words which the Holy Ghost teacheth,
we have been esteemed either ignorant or equivocal and unsound:
whereas it is really matter of conscience to us,
to deliver our belief in such words as the Holy Spirit, in Scripture, teacheth;
and if we add more for illustration,
it is from an experience of the work of the same Spirit in ourselves,
which seems to us the truest way of expounding Scripture,
in what concerns saving knowledge.

[.numbered]
16+++.+++ _Concerning separation._
Because we are separated from the public communion and worship,
it is too generally concluded, that we deny the doctrines received by the church,
and consequently introduce a new religion: whereas we differ least,
where we are thought to differ most: for setting aside some school terms,
we hold the substance of those doctrines believed by the church of England, as to God,
Christ, Spirit, Scripture, repentance, sanctification, remission of sin, holy living,
and the resurrection of the just and unjust to eternal rewards and punishments.
But that wherein we differ most, is about worship and conversation,
and the inward qualification of the soul by the work of God`'s Spirit thereon,
in pursuance of these good and generally received doctrines.
For it is the Spirit of God only that convinces and converts the soul,
and makes those who were dead in trespasses and sins, and in the lusts,
pleasures and fashions of this world, alive to God; that is,
sensible of his mind and will, and of their duty to do them;
and brings to know God and his attributes, by the power of them upon their own souls;
and leads to worship God rightly, which is in his Spirit and in Truth,
with hearts sanctified by the Truth, which is a living and acceptable worship,
and stands in power, not formality, nor in the traditions and prescriptions of men,
in synods and convocations, but in the Holy Spirit.

====

First, in showing us our real wants,
and then in helping our infirmities with sighs and groans, and sometimes words,
to pray for a suitable supply, for which we in our meetings wait upon God,
to quicken and prepare us, that we may worship him acceptably and profitably,
for they go together.
Now, because we are satisfied that all worship to God and exhortations to men,
as praying, praising and preaching, and every other religious duty,
ought to be spiritually performed;
and finding so little of it among professors of Christianity;
the Spirit of God having not that rule and guidance of them, in their lives and worship,
which it ought to have;
and seeing them too generally satisfied with a ministry and worship of man`'s making,
being not qualified, nor led by God`'s Spirit thereunto;
we cannot find that comfort and edification our souls crave and want,
under so cold a ministry and worship.
And for this cause, and no presumptuous contempt, or selfish separation,
or worldly interests, are we, and stand we at this day,
a separate people from the public communion;
and in this we can comfortably appeal and recommend ourselves to God,
the great and last Judge of the acts and deeds of the sons of men.

Lastly, because at the time of our Friends first appearing in this age,
there were a sect of people, newly sprung up, and truly called Ranters,
who were the reverse to the Quakers, for they feared and quaked at nothing,
but made a mock at fearing of God, and at sin, and at hell;
who pretended that love made fear needless, and that nothing was sin,
but to them that thought it so; and that none should be damned at last;
whose extravagant practices exactly corresponded with their evil principles; from hence,
some ignorantly, and too many maliciously involved us and ours with them;
and many of their exorbitances were thereby placed to our account,
though without the least reason, truth or justice.

And because some who were convinced of God`'s Truth,
afterwards dishonoured their profession, through their unfaithfulness to it; and some,
out of weakness perhaps, may have improperly worded what they intended to say,
the whole body of our Friends have been made criminal,
and the religion or principles we profess, have been condemned,
and represented to the world as heresy and blasphemy; an usage so unjust,
that doubtless our adversaries would think it intolerable to be so treated by us.

But as we desire not to render evil for evil,
our great Bishop having taught us another lesson and better practices,
so we desire God Almighty to forgive our causeless enemies, for his Son`'s sake,
as we most freely and heartily forgive them:
believing some may be zealously affected for their educational form of religion,
and zealous against us for our separation; and we are the more inclined to judge so,
because many of us were once in the same way,
and had such thoughts of those that were gone before us.
But it hath pleased the Father of mercies, to do by many of us, as he did by Saul,
that zealous, though mistaken persecutor of the sincere followers of Jesus Christ, Acts 9:3-6.
For as we heard an unusual inward, but powerful voice,
so we also had a more inward, clear and distinguishing sight,
by the illumination of that light which was more than natural,
and shined into our dark and sinful hearts, 2 Cor. 4:6-7.; letting us see them,
as they really were in God`'s sight,
which naturally affected us with deep sorrow and true humiliation;
making us willing to be any thing he would have us be,
provided we might have some sense of his love and favour toward us.
And blessed be his holy and excellent name, we can without vanity, say,
generally speaking, we were not disobedient to that heavenly vision, Acts 26:19,
we had of him, ourselves, the world, and that profession of religion,
where we had our education.
And since by that sight God gave us, we saw he was pure and holy,
and that without holiness none ever could, or can see him, to their joy,
and that we were unfit to approach his holy altar; yea,
the whole world lay in wickedness;
and that profession of religion where we had our education,
was so far from having the power of godliness,
that for the most part it wanted the right form; from such, therefore,
we had a Divine authority to turn away, 2 Tim. 3:5. Which we did,
not in a vaunting mind, but with great sorrow;
wanting to know where the great Shepherd of the sheep fed his flock, Song of Solomon 1:7.
For we desired not to be of those that turned aside
from the footsteps of the flocks of the companions.
Nor was it affectation to popularity, singularity or novelty,
that induced us to a separation; but a fervent desire to know the Lord,
and the work of his translating power upon our souls, being in earnest for heaven,
though for it we lost all our earthly enjoyments. Heb. 11:14-16.

In this solitary and seeking state, it pleased the Lord to meet with us,
and gather us into families or religious societies,
according to Ps. 68:6. And though it hath been a dear separation to us,
considering it cost us the loss of all things,
and the great sufferings and afflictions that have attended us in this despised way,
which men have called heresy, yet the Lord hath blessed us in it,
with the enjoyment of his blessed presence, to our unspeakable joy and comfort.

To conclude, as it hath pleased the Lord to bless us,
in the way we have hitherto been helped to walk,
with that great blessing which ushered in the birth of our blessed Lord into the world,
viz. '`Glory to God, peace on earth,
and good-will to men:`' so we earnestly desire the same upon all our neighbours:
for though we may not be all of one mind in some doctrinal parts of religion,
we must of necessity be all of one sentiment in the great and general duty of holiness,
or else we can never see God.
And if that is our principal aim and endeavour, we shall less fall out by the way,
about words, forms, and the outside of things: but universal charity,
which is the most excellent way,
and without which the best of creeds is but as a sounding brass, etc.;
will silence controversy, and blot out all ignominious characters;
remembering that the great Judge, at the last day, will determine us,
not according to our names, but natures; not our profession, but our lives;
not our bare belief, though of unquestionable truths, but works;
for God will bring every work to judgment, with every secret thing,
whether it be good or evil, Ecc. 12:14.

'''

Near the end of 1698, several clergymen of Norfolk,
in consequence of a meeting held by some Friends near the residence of one of them,
which produced an increase of members in that neighbourhood,
challenged the Friends to a public dispute at West Deerham, in that county.
These clergymen had collected a number of books written by Friends,
from which they endeavoured to draw conclusions injurious to the character of the Society;
but not being able to gain the expected advantage in that way,
they resorted to an expedient more congenial to the former age than to their own.
They published two tracts, vilifying the people called Quakers,
and charging them with blasphemy against God, Jesus Christ, and the holy Scriptures,
and with contempt of civil magistrates.
These tracts were presented to some of the members of parliament,
to prejudice them against the Society and prepare the way for ulterior measures.
But these calumnies were not permitted to pass without reply.
William Penn briefly noticed them in his _Testimony to the Truth,_ above mentioned.
George Whitehead also answered them, refuting their unfounded assertions,
and exposing the ungenerous designs of their authors.
Friends took care to present copies of this answer to the members of parliament,
to counteract the efforts of these clerical opponents.
But as an antidote to these malignant attempts,
while this answer was passing through its stages of preparation and the press,
William Penn issued the following brief remonstrance,
bespeaking the patience of their rulers, till they were better informed.

[.embedded-content-document.address]
--

It does not surprise us to be evilly entreated,
and especially by those that have an interest in doing it.
But if conscience prevailed more than contention, and charity over-ruled prejudice,
we might hope for fairer quarter from our adversaries.

But such is our unhappiness, that nothing less will satisfy them,
than breaking in upon the indulgence that we enjoy;
if they could persuade the government to second their attempts to a new persecution.
In order to which, we perceive they have been hard at work, to pervert our books,
violate our sense, abuse our practice, and ridicule our persons;
knowing very well with whom they have to do,
and that the patience of our profession is their security in abusing it.

However,
if it has weight enough with our superiors to expect
a fresh defence of our principles and practices,
we shall, with God`'s assistance, be ready for their satisfaction once more,
to justify both, against the insults of our restless adversaries: who, otherwise,
we take leave to say, would not deserve our notice,
since we have already repeatedly answered their objections in print,
and think it our duty as well as wisdom,
to use the liberty the government has favoured us with,
in as peaceable and inoffensive a manner as may be.

--

These envious priests and their coadjutor Francis Bugg,
managed to get up two petitions to parliament, one from Norfolk,
and the other from Suffolk;
in which the petitioners complained of the increase
of this Society and the danger thence arising,
not only to the common Christianity of the nation, but to the civil government;
taking care to intimate a belief,
that many Romish emissaries under the disguise of Quakers,
were disseminating their principles among weak Protestants;
and earnestly soliciting the parliament to enter into a
strict examination of their principles and practices,
in order that they might be censured or suppressed, as they should deserve;
and that the true Christian religion might be preserved
from popish superstitions or enthusiastic innovations.
Thomas Ellwood produced a reply, which, in conjunction with the labours of William Penn,
George Whitehead and others,
was so far effectual that when the petitions were submitted
for presentation to the members from those counties,
they had the prudence and magnanimity to suppress them;
notwithstanding the attendance of two clergymen to promote their introduction.

This appears to have been one of the expiring efforts of a mercenary priesthood,
to revive the persecuting statutes of a former age.
But the monarch on the throne, and those who managed the national concerns,
were possessed of much more liberal and tolerant principles, than their predecessors.
And it is no more than justice to William Penn and his brethren,
to remark that their labours, both oral and written,
together with their firmness in maintaining their principles,
contributed in no inconsiderable degree, to that salutary change.

The following epistle, written about this time, is worthy of a place in these memoirs;

[.letter-heading]
For the Friends, brethren and sisters of the Yearly Meeting at Bristol,
for this present year.

[.signed-section-context-open]
Worminghurst, 4th of Third month, 1699.

[.salutation]
My dearly beloved friends and brethren in the Lord,

Dear and precious
is the fellowship of the Lord`'s people to me,
and hath ever been since the first day I knew his precious truth,
and tasted of the power and virtue of it in my soul.
And though I am providentially hindered of a personal presence and enjoyment of you,
(which was as well my design, as desire) yet my spirit is with you,
and my life has a feeling with yours, in the heavenly spirit in which my heart loves,
remembers, and embraces you, ye worthies and faithful.
O! The Lord God of my life shed abroad of his refreshing and confirming power among you,
and by his beloved and only begotten Son, preside in the midst of you,
that the Divine oracle being opened in you,
all may be comforted and edified to his praise,
that hath called and chosen you in this the day of his love, to be a people to him,
to bear his name and show forth the excellency of his power, wisdom and goodness,
to the sons and daughters of men.
O! Let none carnally or carelessly hold forth his glorious name, but in fear,
watchfulness, prayer, and obedience, longsuffering, patience, self-denial,
and love unfeigned.
So let them adorn their holy profession;
then shall Truth`'s righteousness go forth as brightness,
and her salvation as the lamp that burns; and envy shall be confounded,
and ignorance rebuked, and the blind shall see, and the wicked be disappointed.
For it is an evil day in several respects, and calls for faithfulness and diligence,
and blessed shall they be that are not offended in him,
notwithstanding the many contradictions of sinners; nor are weary of well doing,
as though the Lord were slack concerning his precious promises to his people.

So, my dear friends of all ranks and degrees, in gifts and attainments,
stations and services, in and for the Lord`'s blessed truth,
let us mind our daily particular duty,
and the Lord will be sure to give every one of us our daily bread; he will not miss one.
Faithfulness never was disregarded or unrewarded of him.
It is the cold and indifferent that shall dwell in a dry land,
but the willing and obedient shall both eat and inherit the good of the good land.
And let all such as enjoy the Lord`'s bounty, and feed at a full table,
eat and drink worthily, which is in fear; and remember poor Joseph in his afflictions,
and not wax high and wanton, lest they forget the rock from whence they were hewn,
and the pit from whence they were dug, as if they bore the root, and not the root them.
But let such remember and sympathize with the suffering seed of God in the world,
that travailed for them, and in it travail for its resurrection in all;
that others thereby with them may come to know the glorious liberty of the sons of God.

Fathers and elders, young men and little children in the Truth, and church of Christ,
among you,
the God of peace that raised up Jesus from the dead (both within and without you,
and being risen and exalted, has in measure drawn you, with many thousands after him,
even the Lamb, slain from the foundation of the world, that was dead, and is alive,
for we feel it, and shall live forever, and we in and with him, as in his light,
the just man`'s path, we walk to the end, be with all your spirits together and asunder,
and bind you up in his bundle of life, love and power, to his service and glory,
and your everlasting joy.
So says, and prays in love that has lived through the fire, and through the water,
over sea and land, to you, and all God`'s heritage,

Your tenderly affectioned and faithful friend and brother,

[.signed-section-signature]
William Penn.
